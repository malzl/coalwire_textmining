The death toll could beslashedif the plants complied with best practice pollution controls - or eliminated if the plants were phased out.However, coal companies are keen for old plants to keep going as long as possible. This week BHP Billiton, one of the world’s largest coal exporters, published a blogdownplayingthe threat to thermal coal from solar and wind power by relying on old assumptions about the cost of renewables.It is a similar line being pushed by Cambodia’s Minister for Energy whiletoutingfor Chinese investment in more coal plants. India’s Minister for Power, Piyush Goyal, on the other hand, has sombrelyreflectedon the “irrationality” of massive over investment by public and private companies in coal plant capacity.FeaturesToxic loopholes?
