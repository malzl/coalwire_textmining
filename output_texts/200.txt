This coincides withCoal Indiaunveiling plans to become a multi-commodity mining company as the rise of renewable power is curtailing future demand for coal. In theUS, a court has rejected the argument – used in cases around the world – that the rejection of a mining licence would have no climate benefit as other coal would simply be used instead.InGreece, an environmental group is challenging the government’s use of legislation to put the permits for polluting coal plants beyond legal review. In Australia, a shareholder resolution submitted toBHPurges the company to terminate its membership of coal lobby groups advocating policies inconsistent with the Paris Agreement. In South Africa, the accountancy firmKPMGand the consultancy firm McKinsey are  now embroiled in the ever-growing Eskom-Guptas coal deals scandal.

The ruling has prompted the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to defer the approval of further coal projects in the state. An anonymous official has indicated Mahanadi Coalfields, a Coal India subsidiary which operates in Odisha, has produced over 435 million tonnes of coal in breach of one or more licences since 2000 and could be liable to a fine of up to US$3.2 billion.(Economic Times)Court directs US agency to reconsider coal’s climate change impact:AUSappeals court has directed the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to reconsider the climate impacts of issuing four new mining leases to allow the expansion of the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mines in Wyoming. Together the two mines produced 188 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2015, one-quarter of US production. The BLM had argued the mine expansion would have no net effect on climate change as coal power plants would simply source fuel from elsewhere. The court noted the BLM’s claim was not based on evidence presented to the court.(Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,WildEarth Guardians)US rolls back coal regulations:The Trump Administration has ordered a two-year delay in the implementation of 2015 standards regulating the discharge of heavy metals from power plants into lakes and waterways. The deadline for meeting the new limits had previously been set for November 1, 2018. In response to lobbying by a utility lobby group, the US Environmental Protection Agency has also announced it will reconsider parts of a separate rule, which was finalised in 2015, regulating the disposal of coal ash waste.(Utility Dive,The Hill)Greece accused of insulating illegal plants from legal challenges:WWFGreece, represented by ClientEarth, is challenging the Greek Government’s use of legislation to grant and renew permits for coal plants owned by the state-owned Public Power Cooperation. Although the Aarhus Convention requires European Union members to ensure access to environmental justice, Greek legislation of coal plant operating and environmental permits prevent legal review of the projects. If the complaint to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee is upheld, PCC’s coal-fired plants may be vulnerable to legal challenges.(Euractiv,ClientEarth)Adani protests erupt over Australian mine plan:Ten people were arrested on trespass charges after blocking an access road to the Abbot Point coal terminal, which is operated by Adani and is proposed as the export point for coal from the company’s proposed Carmichael mine.

The government has stated it wants power purchase agreements for renewables projects completed by the end of October, but only if they agree to revise prices down to lower than 7.5 US cents per kilowatt hour.(Bloomberg)Gupta scandal fells KPMG South Africa:Nine ofKPMGSouth Africa’s executives, including the CEO and Chief Operating Officer, have quit after a damning internal audit of the accountancy firm’s work for the controversial Gupta family companies. The report found the firm did not “adequately deal” with information on the deal to obtain the Optimum coal mine from Glencore which “called into question the integrity of the Guptas.” The rapidly escalating scandal over the role of the Gupta companies in South Africa has caused the collapse of the UK-based PR firm Bell Pottinger, triggered calls for KPMG to be blacklisted by government agencies and put the spotlight on companies such as McKinsey for their role in the deals.(Bloomberg,Bloomberg)Coal India seeks to diversify away from coal:In abidto reduce its risk to declining coal demand due to the growth of renewable power the government-owned Coal India has announced it wants to diversity into the production of other minerals. In 2014 the Modi government announced Coal India had a production target of 1 billion tonnes by 2020. However, as power demand growth stalls, this year’s original target of 660 million tonnes has been slashed to 600 million tonnes.(Livemint)Renewables passing key tipping points:The founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), Michael Liebriech, told the annual BNEF summit that wind and solar costs were already close to being the cheapest form of new energy almost everywhere in the world. He also argued solar and wind would be cost competitive with existing coal and gas plants before 2030. “Nobody is going to make coal great again,” he said.(BusinessGreen,Michael Liebriech)ResourcesA Resource for Parliament’s Public Enterprises Inquiry Civil Society, Journalists & Engaged Citizens,University of Cape Town’s Graduate School of Business,September 2017.
