All of the traditional coal mines in Cam Pha City, particularly in Quang Hanh and Mong Duong Wards, were severely flooded. Their operations are still paralysed three weeks after the devastating event,”writesChi Lan fromViet NamNews.Suggested Tweet:Mountains of toxic #coal sludge remain after #Vietnam’s floods http://bit.ly/1K9PQVR #pollutionIn China’s Turmoil, Further Declines for Coal“The latest demand-side statistics out of China show a continuation of coal-industry pain: Coal imports into China were down 34.4 per cent year-on-year through July; total China coal sales were 305 million tonnes in July, down 4.9 per cent on the year, and declining 7.7 per cent to 1.945 billion tonnes in the first seven months of the year; and China’s manufacturing demand continues at well below average in a trend that is consistent with the near-term equity market collapse and currency devaluation, all suggesting continued weak commodity demand ahead,”writesTim Buckley from the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.Suggested Tweet:In #China’s turmoil, further declines for #coal http://bit.ly/1NV11AM writes Tim Buckley from @ieefa_institutePrivate Dinners and Lavish Parties: How Coal Giant Adani Charmed Australia's Political Elite“Why is it that for so long and under such extreme pressure, Australian political leaders of both dominant stripes have stood by one of the most controversial coal projects [Adani’s Carmichael mine] in the country’s history? … Could … [it be that it is due to] the close relationships that the company has managed to forge at the highest levels with Australia’s political leaders?,”writesGraham Readfearn inTheGuardian.Suggested Tweet:Private dinners and lavish parties: How #coal giant #Adani charmed Australia's political elite http://bit.ly/1NRlEOc @readfearn #auspolConservative Party Lobbying Against Air Pollution Laws Smells of Political Corruption“Imagine what this policy would look like, had it appeared in the Conservative Party’s manifesto: ‘We will lobby the European Union on behalf of polluting industries to reduce proposed smoke controls, endangering lives, threatening the cognitive health of both children and adults and damaging the country’s competitive position.’ Because it is inconceivable that such a policy could be publicly announced, its pursuit can be understood as an assault on democracy. It reminds us that corruption, like pollution, is not the preserve of either the past or of other parts of the world; it is a potent force in Britain too. Like pollution, it seeps into our lives, invisible but pervasive,”writesGeorge Monbiot in theGuardian.Suggested Tweet:#UK Conservative Party lobbying against air #pollution laws smells of political #corruption http://bit.ly/1NxzvLC @GeorgeMonbiot #coalcampaignsLummi Nation Totem Pole Tours Proposed Pacific Northwest Coal SitesA 6.7-metre high totem pole carved by members of the Lummi Nation of Washington State is touring communities affected by proposed coal export terminals in Washington State, British Columbia and Oregon.
