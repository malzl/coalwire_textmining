A new report estimates the speed ofIndia’senergy transition may mean the country’s coal consumption will peak within a decade. In South Africa, a new report arguesEskom’sperilous financial position would be best served by shelving two partly built coal units, accelerating the retirement of three old plants and the building of more renewables.Meanwhile, the South African Government is embroiled in even more controversy after the main advocate assisting aparliamentary inquiryinto state capture alleged that he was offered a blank cheque by the Minister for State Security. There were scandals elsewhere too. In China, the CEO of a company trying to develop a major mine inMongoliahas been arrested over allegations of a fraudulent loan. In India, questions have been raised about the dropping of charges againstAdanifor the over-invoicing of imported coal and equipment.As the prospects for renewables grow brighter, setbacks and scandals are constraining an ever-diminishing number of new coal projects.FeaturesIndia’s thermal coal peak is within sightOn current trendsIndia’speak thermal coal demand may occur within a decade,writesTim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis inRenewEconomy.New global survey reveals that everyone loves green energy and hates coalA globalsurveyof 26,000 people across 13 countries reveals high levels of support for a coal phase-out and a transition to clean energy,writesDavid Roberts atVox.New global survey reveals that everyone loves green energy and hates #coal @drvox #renewables https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2017/11/20/16678350/global-support-clean-energyThe huge health toll of mountaintop removal mining“We found that as the levels of mining [coal in Appalachia] go up, the health impacts become increasingly more pronounced,”statesMichael Hendryx, Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at Indiana University, in an interview inYale 360.CampaignsHungarian court sets plant permit asideThe Administrative Court of Eger inHungaryhas set aside the environmental license for a proposed 500 megawatt (MW) lignite unit at the existing Matra plant. The court said inadequate definition in the assessment study of the area to be affected by the proposed lignite plant meant the review needed to be redone. The German utility RWE, which is the majority owner of the existing plant, is attempting to sell its stake on the project. However, the court ruling raises doubt about whether the company or potential buyers will persist with the plan for the new unit.(Vilaggazdasag [in Hungarian],CoalSwarm)Top NewsCountries launch coal-free power coalition:Twenty countries havelauncheda coalition to accelerate the global phase-out of existing coal plants and a moratorium on new coal plants without carbon capture and storage.

Private power producers, as well as publicly owned NTPC, are seeking taxpayer funding for plant upgrades or regulatory changes to pass the costs on to consumers. The Centre for Science and Environment argues that despite the power sector being given two years to comply with the new standards, most have not even begun planning for upgrades.(Reuters,Centre for Science and Environment)Alleged bribe attempt referred to South African Parliament:A keyofficialassisting South Africa’s parliamentary inquiry into the “state capture” of Eskom has filed an affidavit with the National Assembly Speaker alleging he was offered a blank cheque by the State Security Minister, Bongani Bongo.
