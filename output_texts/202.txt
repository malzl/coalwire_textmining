InSouth Africa, a decade old pledge to clean-up the air pollution in the Highveld region hasn’t been acted on, in large part because of opposition from Eskom and other big coal burners. InIndia, Greenpeace India has revealed 16 new coal plants commissioned in the first half of 2017 flout new pollution standards announced two years ago.For its part,Coal India– the biggest coal producer in the country – has publicly signaled plans to shift its focus away from coal as renewables undercut demand.

The council’s report estimated that the 1.5°C global temperature increase limit flagged in the Paris Agreement would require the closure of all of Germany’s coal plants within the next two and a half years or within the next 10 years to achieve the 2°C temperature limit. The Greens, who may become partners in a minority government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, want coal plants closed by 2030.(Deutsche Welle)Global coal lobby signs MOU to push Asian coal power:The World Coal Association has formalised a partnership with Jakarta-based ASEAN Centre for Energy to promote the development of coal plants in the ASEAN region. The lobby group – which represents companies including BHP and Glencore – said that the groups would work to support the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Forum on Coal which “works to enhance the image of coal.” The terms of the Memorandum of Understanding have not been released.(World Coal Association)Vedanta subsidiary fined for breaching coal ash limit:The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has fined the owners of the 1980 megawatt (MW) Talwandi Sabo Thermal Power Plant in Punjab for breaching Ministry of Environment and Forests guidelines banning the use of coal with over 34 per cent ash content. The fine was US$1530. The PPCB’s investigation followed complaints of pollution damage to nearby cotton farms.

A further 35,000 MW of coal plants are financially stressed due to factors including the high cost of imported coal, lack of coal supply and cost overruns due to delayed commissioning. Crisil notes few buyers are interested in stressed coal plants and suggested a “very deep haircut or write-down” is needed to make the plants viable.(Hindu Business Line,Crisil)Coal India confirms diversification strategy:Coal India- which produces about 80 per cent of India’s coal - has confirmed it is planning to diversify away from domestic production due to increasing competition from renewables and falling profitability of thermal coal sales. According to an anonymous official, the majority public-owned company is seeking to diversify into solar energy, underground coal gasification, coal-to-liquids and international metals mining.(Livemint,Livemint)Rebuff for Indonesian utility on coal pricing:Indonesia’s Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources, Ignasius Jonan, has rejected a bid by the state-owned utility PLN to lower its operating costs by setting the price of coal for power stations on a ‘cost-plus’ basis rather than the higher prevailing price. PLN is under pressure to increase power prices, cut costs and curtail ambitious expansion plans after the Minister for Finance warned the utility’s ballooning debt was becoming unsustainable. The government recently negotiated a three-year waiver on loan repayments with PLN’s lenders after the utility breached loan covenants.(Reuters,Jakarta Post)US Energy Secretary proposes rule to boost coal:The USSecretary of Energy, Rick Perry, has proposed that within 60 days the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issue rules to increase payments to “fuel-secure” wholesale generators for “grid resiliency services.” Perry has proposed “full recovery” of costs for plants which have a 90-day on-site fuel supply, effectively restricting the rule to coal and nuclear plants. The proposal has been criticised by environmentalists, states and others in the power industry as an unwarranted bailout for coal and nuclear plants.(Bloomberg,Department of Energy)EU offers Poland concessions on coal:ThePresidentof the European Union (EU) has offered Poland generous concessions in negotiations over reforming the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The EU has proposed increasing from 40 per cent to 60 per cent the number of free emissions permits allocated for Poland’s coal power plants. Environmentalists argue this proposal would allow Poland to divert funds intended to support a clean energy transition, and instead extend the life of polluting plants until 2030. Major European countries are demanding restrictions to ensure ETS funds can only be spent on lower emissions generation.(Euractiv,EurActiv)ResourcesAn Australian House of Cards: The Escalating Financial Risk in Adani’s Abbot Point Coal Terminal,Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, October 2017.
