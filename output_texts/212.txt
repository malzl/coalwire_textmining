However, the Social Democratic Party of Germany hassignalledits support for a coal phase-out ahead of negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel over the formation of a new coalition government. AsIndiastruggles with what to do over power utilities flouting new coal plant pollution standards,China’scrackdown on industrial emissions in the Beijing region has delivered a dramatic demonstration on how enforcement action can lead to a rapid improvement in air quality.A shift away from coal projects is happening elsewhere too. InIndonesia, a court has overturned a permit for a Japanese-backed coal plant. InSouth Africa, a provincial government agency has rejected a permit for a proposed coal mine.InAustralia, the Queensland Government has votoed a loan for Adani's proposed Carmichael coal project.FeaturesChina’s coal and industrial clampdown cleans airTheChineseGovernment’s clampdown on cement and steel plants and the small-scale use of coal in the Beijing region has dramatically cut air pollution but the policy has had its problems too,writesLauri Myllyvirta in Greenpeace’sUnearthed.Air #pollution in Beijing region just dropped to a record winter low @laurimyllyvirta @UE https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2017/12/12/beijing-region-sees-record-breaking-drop-winter-air-pollution-levels/AXA sets the bar for fossil fuel divestmentThe French insurance companyAXAhas adopted a policy on fossil fuels that sets a bold new standard for investors and insurance companies,writesPeter Bosshard from the Sunrise Project inHuffpost.AXA sets the bar for fossil fuel #divestment - how will other insurers respond? asks @PeterBosshard #coal #insurance http://bit.ly/2BWH2BK  #OnePlanetSummit https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQ4cH2BVoAAFlTO.jpgIndia’s policy on new coal plant pollution standards?

Residents from Mekarsari and surrounding villages argued that the environmental permit for PLN’s proposed expansion had been improperly issued and there had been no public consultation with the affected communities. The Japanese Government’s export credit agency, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, is a financial backer of the proposed plant expansion.(WALHI,CoalSwarm)South African court rejects coal mineOppositionby the Federation for a Sustainable Environment and other community groups to the proposed Palmietkuilen coal mine has led the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (GDARD) to reject a permit application for the project. The proposed open cut mine would have required the displacement of an estimated 9500 people, affected agricultural lands, an important water catchment and environmentally important grasslands.(Federation for a Sustainable Environment)Top NewsGlobal anti-coal alliance booms:ThePowering Past Coalalliance has expanded to 26 countries and states with California, Sweden, Ethiopia and Latvia announced as new members at the One Planet Summit convened by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Palaszczuk, who holds a narrow majority in the new state parliament, vowed to cancel the loan after being dogged by anti-Adani protests during the first week of the election campaign. The cancellation of the loan — reported to be for A$900 million (US$680 million) — is a major setback for Adani’s hopes of obtaining finance for the whole Carmichael mine project.

The budget package will be voted on by both houses of Congress in mid-December before being sent to President Duterte to be signed into law.(Rappler,Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities)European coal plants falter:A new report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative estimates 54 per cent of the 619 coal and lignite power stations in European Union countries are losing money, with nearly all expected to be loss-making by 2030 as carbon prices rise and pollution upgrades are required. The report estimates onshore wind generation will be cheaper than operating existing coal plants by 2024 and utility scale solar by 2027.(Guardian)Decision on US coal bailout plan deferred:US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, has agreed to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) request for a 30-day extension to decide on a “grid resiliency” rule aimed at bailing out coal and nuclear power plants.

Murray hosted a fundraising dinner for Trump in 2016 and one in 2011 for Perry himself when he was campaigning to be the Republican nominee to challenge Obama.(Vox,In These Times)Australian utility resists government pressure to keep old plant open:AGL, Australia’s largest utility, has rejected lobbying by the federal government to keep the 2000 MW Liddell coal plant open beyond its planned closure date in 2022. A review by AGL estimated that the cost of keeping the plant open would be $A106 (US$80) per megawatt hour (MWh) compared to a mix of renewables, gas, batteries and the upgrade of a coal unit at a nearby plant costing A$83 (US$63) per MWh.(RenewEconomy,Sydney Morning Herald)General Electric slashes power division jobs on coal, gas slump:General Electric (GE) will cut 18,000 jobs from its power division, 18 per cent of the unit’s workforce, due to the slump in demand for new coal and gas power plants. GE attributes the downturn, in part, to the rapid growth of renewables. In mid-November Siemens announced it would cut 6,900 jobs mostly from its power division, pointing out that it expected demand for large turbine, most for gas and coal plants, was expected to be about 110 units a year compared to the global manufacturing capacity of 400 units a year.(New York Times,General Electric)ResourcesLignite of the Living Dead, Carbon Tracker, December 2017.
