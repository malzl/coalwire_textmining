July 20, 2017Issue #191|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteLast week the International Energy Agency made a strong declaration: global coal investments may havepeakedin 2015-2017. China continues to face coal overcapacity, which threatens itswatersupply. Morgan Stanley has warned the low cost ofsolarmay turn many of India’s coal plants into stranded assets. Economists predict adeclinefor Australia’s coal exports, and financial firms warn of climaterisksin coal investments.Yet manyG20countries continue to publicly finance coal projects abroad over renewables, with theUSsuggesting the UN Climate Fund should be used for coal. Chinese firms are competing for coal projects in theBalkans, while bothChinaandJapanrecently funded coal plants in Africa. And China’s industrial activity–along with its coal use–are up, although analysts say it is likely a short-termbumpfrom a credit boost.-Christine Shearer, Guest EditorFeaturesInternational Energy Agency says coal investment may have peakedPointing to coal overcapacity in China, declining demand in India, and uncertainty in other regions, the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2017concludes financing for coal-fired generation “may have reached an all-timepeakin the 2015-2017 period,”writesSimon Evans inCarbon Brief.Seven charts show why the @IEA thinks coal investment has already peaked | @DrSimEvans http://j.mp/2u97MOPChinese investors compete for Bosnia–and world–coal projectsThere are five coal-fired power plants being considered inBosnia & Herzegovina, with two of the projects – Tuzla and Banovici – just 30 kilometers from each other. Both are backed by different Chinese companies with loan offers from two different Chinese banks, reflecting a competitive push by Chinese firms to export coal projects abroad,writesClare Nuttall inbne IntelliNews.Top NewsUS wants to use United Nations climate fund for coal plants:In a G20 statement on climate change, theUSadded language saying the country will seek to use the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF)–designed to aid nations hard hit by climate change–to promote the construction of coal-fired power plants around the world. Although President Trump pulled out of the UN climate agreement, the US has a seat on the GCF managing board for a year.(Bloomberg)China’s industrial output and coal consumption up:China announced its Gross Domestic Product expanded 6.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting acredit boostto heavy industry sectors such as steel. The growth in industrial output together with a below-average year for hydropower has led China’s coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions to rebound, and air pollution to rise in industrial centers. However wind and solar power use are also up, increasing by 18 and 35 per cent respectively on year.(Greenpeace,Quartz)Japan donates billions for Africa power projects, including coal:On July 6, 2017, the Japanese government announced it would donate US$6 billion to the African Development Bank (AfDB) to help fund power plant construction and other energy-related infrastructure projects in Africa. AfDB projects may includecoal plantsthat use domestic coal.(Global Construction Review)China loans to Africa coal plant days before low emissions pledge:On July 6, 2017, the China Development Bank (CDB) announced it would loan US$1.5 billion to Eskom to fund completion of its 4,800-megawattMedupi coal plantin South Africa. The loan came just two days before a G20 climate action plan, agreed to by China, called on multilateral development banks to support low emission projects. Although the CBD is not a multilateral bank, it is a state-run institution.(Climate Home,CoalSwarm)Arguably, China will not need new coal for quite a long time, possibly never,saidIEA chief economist Laszlo Varro during a press call about IEA’sWorld Energy Investment 2017.NewsAustralia:Energy Minister said government hasno plansto build a coal-fired power station despite public lobbying by senior Nationals.Australia:New South Wales state government willbuyhalf of coal exploration licenses held by China Shenhua Energy to protect fertile farmland.China:The country’s domestic coal production rose10.6 per centto 308 million tonnes in June from a year ago.India:Owners ofEconomic & Political Weeklydeletearticles accusing Adani Group of tax evasion after Adani threatens to sue, prompting the editor to resign in protest.Indonesia:Analysts find Japan, China and South Koreafinancing18 out of the 22 coal power deals proposed in Indonesia since 2010.Poland:Energy Minister says country will generate60 per centof its electricity from coal by 2030, compared to current 80 per cent.South Africa:Netherlands-based Vitol Groupdropsplan to buy a 7.61 per cent stake in the Richards Bay Terminal to export eight million tonnes of coal annually.United Kingdom:Drax Groupsubmitsa planning application to convert one of its three remaining coal-fired units to gas before Britain’s 2025 coal phase-out.Arctic:New study inNaturefinds majority ofmercurycontamination in Arctic tundra came from burning coal.Companies + MarketsConsol Energy to spin off coal operations:Consol Energy has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission its intention to split the company. Ownership of the company’s coal mines and coal terminal will likely stay under the Consol Energy name. Its natural gas operations, which have become the company’s focus, will be under a new, as-yet-unnamed company, possibly by the end of the year.(Pittsburgh Business Times)Economists predict shrinking demand for Australian coal exports:While the Australian government has projected its coal export market will grow nearly 9 per cent by 2022, an analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) suggests the market for Australian coal willcontract. The reduction would primarily be due to declining demand from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which currently make up 70 per cent of Australia’s export coal market. IEEFA projects declining demand in each country of up to 2 per cent each year.(Guardian)India Ratings sees stagnant coal demand and decreased imports for India:India Ratings expects domestic coal consumption growth in India to remain tepid on account of stagnant demand from thermal power plants, due to the increased competition from renewables. Despite this, India’s domestic coal production is set to increase on account of government efforts to reduce imports. Given the flat demand for coal and increasing supply, India Ratings said India’s coal imports will likely decline 15 to 20 million tonnes annually over the next two to three years.(Economic Times)Duke seeks rate hike to cover coal ash clean-up costs:Duke Energy Progress has proposed a 14.9 per cent rate hike in North Carolina to pay for closing and cleaning up coal ash ponds at eight of its current and former coal plants. Additionally, over a quarter of the estimated US$478 million a year in new revenue would go toward future coal ash pond closings. Environmental groups argue Duke mismanaged its coal waste for decades and should bear all the costs for the clean up.(Charlotte Business Journal)Insurers and financial firms move away from coal, warn of risks:The world’s second largest reinsurer Swiss Re said it will take social and governance (ESG) criteria into account for its US$130 billion in holdings, including avoiding investments related to coal. Additionally, asset manager Schroders–which oversees US$520 billion for global investors–launched anonline toolto track key climate indicators, including coal production, so that investors can decrease their risk exposure to climate change.(Swiss Re [PDF],Financial Times)Morgan Stanley predicts coal overcapacity in India:Morgan Stanley Research has downgraded the Indian utilities industry, saying the market has yet to fully price-in the impact ofsolarpower becoming the cheapest form of new electricity generation. The group argues coal plants currently without a power purchase agreement (PPA) may find demand undercut by solar, further lowering coal plant utilization rates and making it harder to recoup development costs and pay off loans.(LiveMint)It is clear that over the next few years, the [India] state electricity boards will think hard before signing even short- or medium-term (3-10 years) coal-based PPAs given that solar has achieved grid parity,wroteMorgan Stanley Research in its downgrade of India utilities.ResourcesOvercapacity, Over-withdrawal: How tackling coal power overcapacity can ease water stress,Greenpeace, July 5, 2017.This report finds nearly20 per cent (213,000 megawatts) of China’s coal capacity will be redundant by 2020 and could be scrapped with no interruption to grid operations.
