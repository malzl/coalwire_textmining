Financial tide recedes on coal, Glencore opposes Adani subsidy and Reliance dumps Indonesian projectsOctober 8, 2015View this email in your browsereditor's noteFinancial stress is the phrase that best sums up the coal industry’s last week. The Polish Government rearranged the deck chairs for its loss-making coal companies while a South African railway company executive has flagged it is looking to government to insulate it from losses due to the falling coal export price. Old coal projects stagger on though, with the NSW Government approving a new export terminal for Newcastle … while acknowledging there is no current need for it.featuresThe Polish Government’s illusionists’ trick with coalThe Polish Government has adapted the illusionists’ old pea-and-thimble trick by taking the assets of a loss-making coal company and hiding them under the cover of another state-owned company … but it is a pre-election ploy which is fooling no-one,writesBob Burton inEndCoal.Suggested Tweet:The Polish Government’s illusionists’ trick with #coal http://bit.ly/1WNRwbI @bobburtonozBHP Billiton’s carbon bombBHP Billiton’s recent annual report reveals the company has 16 billion tonnes of coal tucked away in projects from Colombia, Australia and the forests of Indonesia, making the company’s coal stockpile   one of the world’s largest unexploded ‘carbon bombs’,writesBob Burton inEndCoal.Suggested Tweet:#BHPBilliton’s carbon bomb http://bit.ly/1VEBrrH @bobburtonoz #coalIndonesian economy in trouble for betting on coalThe coal industry not only destabilises the Indonesian economy but also carries extremely high social costs in terms of health, social and climate impacts,writesArif Fiyanto from Greenpeace Southeast Asia in theJakarta Globe.Suggested Tweet:Indonesian economy in trouble for betting on #coal http://bit.ly/1PhbDwA @ken_arf01 #Indonesia #climatecampaignsVillagers take coal protest to Indonesian President’s palacePolice arrested – and subsequently released – 43 people protesting in front of President Jokowi’s palace against the proposed 2000 MW Batang coal plant in central Java. 74 landowners are refusing to sell their land for the project, which would impact five villages and pollute rich coastal fishing grounds. Two Japanese companies – J-Power and Itochu – own two-thirds of the joint venture company for the project, which is seeking funding from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

It is reported that the policy, if adopted, would be announced before the commencement of the Paris climate negotiations on November 30.(Blue & Green Tomorrow,Bloomberg)Minister extends Mumbai coal terminal operation:Residents have condemned the state environment minister’s decision to extend the coal-handling operations of the Mumbai Port Trust until 2017 despite the trust’s earlier announcement it would clear the site by October 31. After lobbying from coal users, the minister directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to allow the port’s coal operation to continue subject to conditions including the use of covered coal trucks and coal dumps. However, residents and environmentalists argue the ‘consent to operate’ for the coal-handling operation expires at the end of the month and the port has admitted it cannot meet environmental standards.(Times of India,Times of India)NSW Government approves extra Newcastle terminal:The Planning Assessment Commission has approved the proposed T4 coal export terminal at Newcastle even though it notes “there is no immediate need for the development.” The proposed 70 million tonnes per annum terminal has been the subject of a strong community campaign, in part due to the additional air pollution which would be generated from coal being transported through suburban areas via uncovered rail wagons. Approval for the US$3.4 billion project lapses in five years.(Planning Assessment Commission,Newcastle Herald)Vietnamese coal-related death toll could grow by over five times:Researchers from Harvard University estimate that 4300 people a year die from coal-related pollution - with the potential of an increase to 25,000 premature deaths a year if all proposed coal plants are built. The results of the report were presented at the ‘Coal and Coal Power: The Unknowns’ conference in Hanoi organised by Green Innovation and Development Center in association with the Vietnam Union of Scientific and Technological Associations.(Tuoi Tre News,Greenpeace Southeast Asia)“This comprehensive report [on air and water pollution in districts in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with coal mines and power plants] shows very serious levels of pollution in the area in question.

In 2008 the company bought the three Indonesian projects – which had a combined potential capacity of 30 million tonnes a year – to supply the company’s proposed 3960 MW Krishnapatnam Ultra Mega Power Project in Andhra Pradesh. However, the Indonesian Government’s September 2010 regulation banning the export of coal below an international benchmark price made the power project unviable.(Economic Times)Falling price increases risk of South African stranded assets:An executive of the South African government-owned rail company Transnet has suggested the government should consider financial support for the coal sector if coal export prices fall to US$45 a tonne. Speaking in a personal capacity, Transnet’s General Manager Divyesh Kalan said if prices continued to fall marginal producers would struggle to meet their obligations under the take-or-pay rail contracts. “If the mines are in financial trouble, Transnet will also be,” he said.(Mining Weekly)US utility signals exit from future CCS projects:NRG Energy, a major US electricity utility, has announced that while it will complete the construction of the Petra Nova Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project in Texas it will not invest in further projects. The US$1 billion Petra Nova CCS project, to be commissioned in 2016, aims to capture 90 per cent of the carbon dioxide from the existing 240 MW Parish coal plant and sell it for use in ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery’ (EOR) projects nearby. NRG Chief Executive David Crane acknowledges that CCS for EOR was attractive when the oil price was between US$75 to $100 a barrel but, with oil selling for US$45 a barrel, it is no longer viable.(Houston Chronicle)Citigroup cuts coal financing, ANZ weakens standards:In an update to its environmental policy framework Citigroup has reported it has begun to cut lending to coal mining and will continue “reducing our global credit exposure to coal mining companies.” However, ANZ - the largest Australian lender to fossil fuel projects – has gone in the opposite direction. Market Forces Campaigner Julien Vincent points out that its new policy actually weakens their standards for coal plants from the existing 0.69 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour (tCO2/MWh) to 0.8 tCO2/MWh. Nor has ANZ ruled out funding Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal mine.(Rainforest Action Network,Market Forces)Rio Tinto sale signals possible exit from coal:In what is seen as the first stage of Rio Tinto’s exit altogether from coal the company has sold its 40 per cent stake in the Bengalla mine in NSW’s Hunter Valley to New Hope Corporation and restructured its Coal & Allied joint venture with Mitsubishi Development. Rio Tinto is also negotiating the sale of its two other Hunter Valley mines and may be open to selling its remaining Queensland metallurgical coal mines. In late 2014 Rio Tinto sold its Benga project in Mozambique – which it bought for US$3.7 billion – for just US$50 million. It has also been attempting to sell its minority stake in SouthGobi Resources which has coal exploration projects in Mongolia.(Rio Tinto,Sydney Morning Herald)resourcesResources and Energy Quarterly: September 2015, Australian Government Department of Industry, October 2015.
