US coal port defeated; blockade shuts Australia’s largest coal port; 3500 protest Indonesian plant.May 13, 2016View this email in your browsereditor's noteThe biggest development by far of the last week was the success of the Lummi Nation in defeating the proposed Gateway Pacific coal terminal in Washington state in the US. On top of that over 2000 people shut down Australia’s coal port in Newcastle for a day while 3500 people protested in the streets of Jakarta against the proposed Japanese-backed 2000 megawatt (MW) Central Java coal plant. In NSW five landowners won a precedent-setting case in blocking coal exploration being allowed to proceed on their farmlands. To cap it all off, for the first time since 1882 there was no coal-fired electricity in the UK grid. A coal-free world is becoming more tangible by the day.Bob BurtoncampaignsFirst Nation defeats US coal port planOn May 9, the Army Corps of Engineers preemptively denied a permit for the proposed Gateway Pacific coal export terminal outside of Bellingham, Washington, ruling the project’s impact on the fishing rights of the Lummi Nation would be more than “de minimis,” the legally-protected standard. The Chairman of the Lummi Nation called the ruling a “historic victory for treaty rights and the constitution.” The project is considered “likely dead” unless terminal sponsor SSA Marine chooses to alter plans or appeal against the decision in federal court.(Bellingham Herald,Sightline Institute)Tweet:Lummi Nation defeats giant coal export terminal at Cherry Point in Washington http://bit.ly/1Tzk1WF #coalNSW landowners win case blocking explorationThe world’s 8359 coal power plant units consume enough water each year to meet the basic needs of one billion people,writesJoe Sandler Clarke inEnergyDesk.Tweet:#Coal plants risk global #water shortage @JSandlerClarke @EnergyDesktop newsJapanese coal plants plan on shaky grounds:Japan’s planned and under construction coal-fired power plants exceeds the capacity required to replace the retiring fleet by 191 per cent, according to a new report by Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment.
