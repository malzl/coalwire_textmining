April 6, 2017Issue 177|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteThe Trump Administration’s attack on Obama era regulations was widely reported as unlikely to make any significant difference to the US coal industry – beyond its symbolic value. Even so, the US coalindustryis lobbying for the weakening of more pollution control regulations affecting coal plants. A sobering reminder of thehealth costsimposed by coal power is continued in two studies detailing how coal plant pollution in the US has cut the birth weight of babies – with lifelong consequences.However, momentum away from coal continues. InAlaska, plans for a massive open cut coal mine – long opposed by a broad coalition of native communities and others – has collapsed after a potential investor backed away.InGermanya new owner of Vattenfall’s coal assets has scrapped plans for a new coal plant and the mine expansion it would have required. In India, as the first stage of the massiveKudgi plantnears commissioning, NTPC is considering dropping an already approved 1600 megawatt (MW) expansion plan and instead looking to build a solar farm as a substitute.FeaturesReformed European carbon market must no longer fund coalAs crucial talks over reform of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme commence, the European Parliament should insist future funding goes only towards projects that contribute to the clean energy transition,writesJoanna Flisowska, coal policy coordinator at Climate Action Network Europe..@Europarl_EN needs to ensure that reformed #ETS does not subsidise #coal power - op-ed by CAN's @j_flisowska http://www.euractiv.com/section/emissions-trading-scheme/opinion/reformed-carbon-market-must-no-longer-fund-coal/ pic.twitter.com/OIVLUOqdJWNavajo and Hopi tribes grapple with the prospect of life after coalThe likely closure later this year of the 2250 MW Navajo Generating Station in Arizona has forced Navajo and Hopi tribal governments to grapple with whether to seek subsidies to keep the uneconomic plant going or pursue a different development path,writesBenjamin Storrow inE&E News.Trump talks about saving #coal.

The mine – which would have destroyed 19 kilometres of salmon spawning habitat and required road, port and conveyor infrastructure – was opposed by a coalition of native communities, fishing industry operators and environmentalists. The company said it dropped the project after a potential investor declined to back the company’s plan.(Alaska Dispatch News,Sierra Club)Coalition of native communities, #salmon fishers & environmentalists celebrate end of #Chuitna coal mine in #Alaska https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2017/04/03/chuitna-coal-mine-shelved-after-company-suspends-permittingNew owner drops plan for lignite mine expansion in GermanyLEAG, thenew ownerof lignite mines formerly owned by the Swedish company Vattenfall, has scrapped plans for a new coal plant in Janschwalde and the associated expansion of the nearby lignite mine which is due to close in 2023. LEAG, a subsidiary of the Czech mining company EPH, has also postponed a decision on the proposed expansion of the Welzow-Sud lignite mine and scaled back plans for the extension of the Nochten mine. “These investments are no longer justifiable from a business perspective, due to the conditions that federal policy and economy brought on in the meantime,” said LEAG CEO Helmar Rendez.(CleanEnergyWire)New owner scraps plans to expand #lignite mine in eastern #Germany https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/new-owner-scraps-plans-expand-east-german-lignite-mine @LEAG_de #Energiewende #endcoal #climateTop NewsUS studies reveal reduced baby birth weight linked to coal:Astudyhas found a significant reduction in the birth weight of babies due to coal power used after two nuclear plants were closed for inspections after the Three Mile Island accident. The study found the weight of babies in areas with increased coal generation fell by about 5.4 per cent after the two nuclear plants were shut down. Another study found pollution from a coal plant in Pennsylvania affected the birth weight of babies in four wealthy New Jersey counties up to 48 kilometres downwind.(Guardian,Washington Post)Indian utility looks at dropping plant expansion for solar:NTPC, which generates almost one-quarter of India’s electricity, is considering scrapping a 1600 MW expansion of the Kudgi Super Critical Thermal Power Project in Karnataka state due to the rapidly falling cost of solar power. The project was approved as a 4000 MW plant despite strong community resistance. Three 800 MW units are set to be commissioned this year in part due  to financial support from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.(Economic Times,CoalSwarm)India insists pollution standards on coal plants begin in 2017:The Minister of Environment, Anil Madhav Dave, has reaffirmed new pollution control standards will come into effect on December 6, 2017 despite lobbying by the Association of Power Producers that they be delayed. A petition organised by a coalition of civil society groups and signed by 105,000 people demanded the government confirm the standards would not be relaxed. To date, only six of the 162 existing power plants affected by the standards have installed sulphur dioxide pollution control equipment to meet the new standard.(Times of India,Greenpeace India)Adani gets 60-year water licence for Carmichael mine:The Queensland State Government has approved a 60-year water licence for Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal mine, with minimal restrictions. The licence allows Adani to extract up to 26 million litres of water a day by 2029 at no cost if the mine produces 60 million tonnes of thermal coal a year. The agreement contains no trigger event to allow the contract to be cancelled. Court documents submitted on behalf of Adani reveal the company proposes to export high-ash content, low-quality coal to India and sell its higher quality coal elsewhere.(Sydney Morning Herald,ABC News)European Union coal emissions fall:Carbon dioxide emissions from power stations and other major combustion plants, which account for 65 per cent of the European Union total, fell by four per cent in 2016 compared to the preceding year. Emissions from coal power generation fell by 11 per cent in 2016 with over half of the drop attributable to the rapid decline of coal power in the UK.  Power sector emissions in Germany and Poland – the two largest polluters – fell by only four and one per cent respectively. The EU has set the price of carbon dioxide emissions at just €5 (US$5.35) per tonne, a level too low to ensure significant fuel switching from lignite-fired plants in Germany and Poland.(Sandbag,Climate Home)US coal lobby wants more pollution regulations axed:Theheadof the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), a coal industry lobby group, wants the Trump Administration to delay the November 2018 implementation deadline for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Coal Combustion Residual Rule and Effluent Guidelines regulating coal plant waste disposal. ACCCE, which represents companies including Peabody Energy and American Electric Power, wants the regulations deferred in the hope of stalling planned coal plant closures. However, a survey of a dozen utility executives has found Trump Administration efforts to try and reverse Obama-era policies will make no difference to planned coal plant closures.(SNL,SNL)NewsAustralia:New National Pollutant Inventory datarevealspollution spike from coal mines and plants.Bangladesh:Threearrestedto face charges of misappropriating compensation funds for proposed Matarbari plant.Bosnia Herzegovina:Pollution from coal-burning ArcelorMittal steel plantgripscity of 100,000 people.India:Anti-corruption agencyregisterscases against three companies and ex-executive of Coal India subsidiary over cut-price coal deals.Indonesia:Over 2000 peopleprotestedcoal projects and called for investigation of corruption allegations.UK:Eighty per centfall[paywall] in coal rail freight over three years creates space for more passenger trains.UK:Governmentestimatesno “significant” carbon capture and storage capacity likely before 2035.US:Kemper CCS plant commissioningdelayedagain as costs rise by US$99 million to US$7.2 billion.Companies + MarketsIndonesia slashes power demand forecast:The Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources, Ignasius Jonan, has confirmed Indonesia estimated electricity capacity required in 2019 has been cut from 90,500 MW to 79,200 MW, a 12 per cent decline. According to the draft plan, the target share to be supplied by coal plants is 50.4 per cent, almost identical to the 2016 plan. The revised plan assumes power demand growth after 2019 rebounds to the extent that the capacity of the grid in 2025 will be only 2600 MW lower than estimated in the 2016 plan.(Jakarta Post [paywall])European utilities pledge no new coal plants after 2020, with caveats:Eurelectric, the peak lobby group for major European utilities, has announced member companies do “not intend to invest in new-build coal-fired power plants after 2020.” However, the lobby group notes that its Polish and Greek member associations did not agree to the post-2020 provision. While the lobby group stated companies are investing to achieve “carbon-neutral electricity supply by 2050” it makes no commitment on developing a phase out plan for the existing fleet of coal plants. TheGlobal Coal Plant Trackerindicates 22 proposed coal plants of which two are in Greece and 10 in Poland.(Guardian,Eurelectric)Report warns backing Indonesian plant would breach Equator Principles:A report by BankTrack and Greenpeace Netherlands says funding the proposed 1000 MW Cirebon 2 plant would be in breach of the Equator Principles. A consortium of banks considering support for the plant – including Mizuho Financial Group, MUFG and SMBC and ING – have signed the Equator Principles. The report found the project, which is the subject of a legal challenge, would cause the loss of livelihoods for local farmers and fishermen due to land seizures and the impacts of air and water pollution.(BankTrack & Greenpeace Netherlands)Coal India production grows but sales stall:During the 2016-17 financial year – which runs from April to the end of March – Coal India increased production by 2.9 per cent to 554.1 million tonnes but sales increased only by 1.6 per cent to 543.2 million tonnes. Coal India stockpiles were recently estimated at 70 million tonnes, with the Central Electricity Authority reporting a further 27 million tonnes stockpiled at power plants. Coal India is hoping to boost sales by landing supply contracts for some of the up to 50,000 MW of plants which are under construction or which have no long-term fuel supply agreement.(Bloomberg,Economic Times)Two coal plants in Germany closed:The major German power utility Steag has closed two coal plants, Voerde and Voerde West in North Rhine Westphalia. The plants, which were commissioned between 1971 and 1985, had a combined capacity of 2200 MW. The closures have been welcomed by Klima Allianz, which has called for the development of a coal phase-out plan for the country’s remaining coal plants.(Reuters,Klima Allianz)Asian clean energy challenge to coal grows but obstacles remain:While the Japanese Government has been a major backer for new coal plants around the world, the slowing deployment of domestic solar capacity has spurred Japanese companies to invest in major solar projects, especially in India. Japanese companies are also shifting to invest in wind and battery technology. Currently countries with major proposed new coal plant capacity – such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand or the Philippines – have a far higher cost of renewables than China and India, largely due to limited deployment and policy support.(Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis,Medium)ResourcesGuarding the Galilee Documentary (2017) - Trailer,April 2017.
