Or will the banks, led by the Top 20 coal banks, continue to provide financial life support to coal-mining companies and coal-dependent energy utilities?,”writesYann Louvel and Greig Aitken from BankTrack.Suggested Tweet:#Climate test cases for banks – 4 dodgy #coal deals to watch in 2015 http://bit.ly/1K9KU15 #BanksQuitCoal pic.twitter.com/xdvSF8LVYv @BankTrackSouthern African Women Stand Their Ground Against Big Coal“More than 50 grassroots women activists gathered from around the region in late-January 2015 to stand their ground against Big Coal.

In a knife-edge state election the incumbent Liberal National Party government is likely to narrowly lose. The exact composition of the state parliament is unlikely to be resolved for at least a week. As a result the federal Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, has suspended decision-making on permits for the dumping of dredging waste from the proposed expansion of the Abbot Point Coal Terminal until a new government is sworn in. The deferral has been welcomed by environment groups which are hopeful that a new government will place greater emphasis on the protection of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.(RenewEconomy,ABC News)“The value of undeveloped thermal coal resources requiring new infrastructure is limited,”wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a January 2015 report titled ‘Thermal coal reaches retirement age’. (Not available online.)top newsNew study on dangers of air pollution in China:Greenpeace and Peking University have released a study showing that over a quarter of a million people in some of China’s major cities could face premature death because of high levels of air pollution. In the 31 provincial capitals on average 90 out of every 100,000 people could die prematurely every year as a result of high levels of fine particulate in the air. The findings mean that one out of every seven deaths in the cities is due to air pollution, making early deaths from fine particulate matter as risky as smoking.(Greenpeace Energy Desk)US carbon capture project collapses:The US Department of Energy (DOE) has withdrawn funding for the proposed FutureGen 2.0 carbon capture and storage project in Illinois due to the inability of the project to use the funds by a September deadline.

But unicorns are more likely,”Sean Casten, the president and CEO of Recycled Energy Development,toldthe US energy trade journalSNLafter the collapse of the FutureGen 2.0 carbon capture and storage project in Illinois.companies + marketsCoal prices to keep sliding:While currency deprecation against the US dollar has assisted exporters from Colombia, Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, Russian producers have been the greatest beneficiary. With export coal contracts written in US dollars, depreciation against the US dollar benefits exporters. However, a growing supply glut caused by new capacity coming on stream, especially in Australia, continues to drive prices down.(Bloomberg)Coal India share sale:The Modi government’s sale of 10 per cent of its stake in Coal India is likely to raise about US$3.6 billion for the government. While the sale prompted a strike by unions, the offer was over-subscribed. The government sold a 5 per cent share in Coal India in 2010 but late last year one of its largest private shareholders, the Children’s Investment Fund, sold its stake due to concern that that the company’s profits were being suppressed due to coal prices being set at non-commercial rates.(Bloomberg,Wall Street Journal)Indian company has US$2bn plan for Mozambique:International Coal Ventures Limited (ICVL), a joint venture of Indian government-owned coal consumers, has announced plans to spend US$2 billion establishing a coal-to-liquid project, a 300 MW power station and expand production at its Benga coal mine from five to 13 million tonnes per annum by 2017.
