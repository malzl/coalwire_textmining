If granted, the exemptions will violate the conditions of a World Bank loan made to Eskom to build the plant.Earthlife Africa Jhb'sProject Coordinator, Tristen Taylor, states, “Neither The World Bank nor Eskom seem to be particularly concerned about the health impacts of Medupi being exempted from air quality standards or from FGD being so delayed that the likelihood of it ever being installed enters the realm of miracles. This violates the contract the Bank and Eskom made with the people of Lephalale: they promised to prevent dangerous and possibly lethal pollution, but now prefer excessive profits instead. In effect, The World Bank and Eskom lied to us all.”top newsAustralia:Three farmers and an environmental group have commenced a three-week-long legal challenge to the approval of the GVK- Hancock Coal mega-mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin.
