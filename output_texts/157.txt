Engie is set to announce the closure of theHazelwoodpower station in Australia, one of the world’s dirtiest, while a proposed coal plant inTurkeyhas been abandoned after a long-running community campaign. InPakistan, the environmental impact statement on a proposed coal port development has been rejected by the provincial regulator.TwoFrench banks, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, have announced they will no longer directly finance coal plants from the start of next year but will increase lending for renewables; Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports substantial drops in the cost ofwind powerin the second half of 2016. With the cost of renewables falling fastVietnam’sMinister for the Environment has told a meeting of international development partners and donors, “we should switch from black to green energy sources.” Vietnam is currently ranked as having the fifth largest ‘pipeline’ of new coal plants.FeaturesProtests over water safety, bank financing rock Bangladesh coal plantsWith increasing opposition to the financing and construction of the proposed Rampal coal plant near the Sundarbans World Heritage site, Bangladesh’s coal plans are looking increasingly shaky,writesKeith Schneider inCircle of Blue.#Rampal #coal-fired generating station is defended by government, opposed by UN, & assailed by #Bangladesh citizens http://www.circleofblue.org/2016/world/protests-water-safety-bank-financing-rock-bangladesh-coal-plants/Bosnia faces legal action over Chinese-backed coal dashCompanies pushing ahead with plans for four new coal plants in Bosnia and Herzogovina – which would add almost as much as the existing coal capacity of the country – are struggling to attract finance in the face of a sustained community campaign and legal challenges,writesMegan Darby inClimate Home.#BosniaHerzogovina faces legal action over Chinese-backed #coal dash @climatemegan http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/10/28/bosnia-faces-legal-action-over-chinese-backed-coal-dash/CampaignsTurkish coal plant dumpedAlong-runningcommunity campaign by residents of Aliaga in Turkey against coal power pollution has forced Azerbaijan’s state-owned energy company SOCAR to abandon a proposed 672 megawatt (MW) coal plant. SOCAR proposed the plant in 2012 to power a new oil refinery which is currently under construction. However, concern about pollution and the likely impact on the ancient city of Kyme, an important archaeological site, led to sustained public opposition and legal challenges. Seven export credit agencies, which are financing the refinery, informed residents SOCAR had dropped its power plant, a decision welcomed by local and national groups.(CEE Bankwatch Network,CoalSwarm)Victory! #SOCAR tells the financiers: STEP coal power plant project is off the table! #Aliaga #Turkey http://bit.ly/2dUtkI6 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwFf39mWAAAirrd.jpgTwo more French banks back away from coalUnderpressurefrom a coalition of NGOs Societe Generale, France’s third largest bank, has announced it will no longer directly finance coal plants from January 1, 2017, “or related infrastructure anywhere in the world.” A few days earlier Credit Agricole announced it would end lending for coal plants. Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack welcomed the announcements but noted Credit Agricole and Societe Generale are financing new coal plants in Indonesia with the latter also financing the Punta Catalina project in the Dominican Republic. Nor does the new policy apply to corporate financing and services, the major form of support the banks provide to the coal industry.(Reuters,Friends of the Earth France and BankTrack)Au revoir to #coal plant project finance @CreditAgricole & @SocieteGenerale.

Villagers and the Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industry, representing over 70 business owners, objected to the likely pollution from the project and doubted the availability of water for the plant.(Dawn,Dawn)Engie set to close Australia’s most polluting plant:Theownerof the Hazelwood plant, the French government-owned Engie, is set to announce the plant will close by April 1, 2017. The 1542 MW brown coal-fired plant is Australia’s most polluting power station with the first of its eight units commissioned in 1964. The Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, will head a taskforce to develop an economic transition plan for the Latrobe Valley.(The Age,Sydney Morning Herald)UNICEF calls on countries to cut fossil fuel pollution:A UNICEF report, titledClear the Air for Children, finds two billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution, including from the “heavy use” of fossil fuels, exceeds minimum air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization. The report, released ahead of a meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Morocco next week, urges governments to reduce fossil fuel combustion and invest instead in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.(UNICEF)Bankrupt US companies become generous political donors:Political action committees (PACs) of coal companies which are in bankruptcy – or were until recently – have donated over US$800,000 to US political campaigns with most going to Republican candidates. PACs associated with Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal and Peabody Energy donated US$695,000 to federal campaigns and, together with Patriot Coal, a further US$165,000 to state campaigns. PACs are funded by company employees.(Miami Herald)US railway coal dust pollution case heads to trial:A US District Court judge has ruled that coal dust which falls directly into waterways from coal trains would be classified as “point sources” of pollution under the federal Clean Water Act. Seven environmental groups are suing BNSF Railway arguing the use of dust suppressants sprayed on coal in uncovered wagons is insufficient to prevent the pollution of waterways. The trial will begin on November 7.(Oregonian)Colombian river diversion work for coal mine begins:Luz Ángela Uriana Epiayú, who lives near the Cerrejon coal mine, was attending BHP Billiton’s annual general meeting in London when news came through that the Arroyo stream which supplies water to her village had been diverted to cater for the expansion of the mine. Cerrejon Coal Company – a joint venture of BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore – declined to respond to queries submitted by theGuardian.(Guardian)“Renewables now account for around 50% of all new power generation, and last year saw a record of 121GW of combined solar and wind power capacity installed.

Last week Vietnam's Minister for the Environment, Tran Hong Ha, told a meeting of international development partners and donors “we should switch from black to green energy sources.”(VNExpress)Dow Chemical doubts Chinese coal-to-chemicals boom:Dow Chemical Company’s CEO, Andrew Liveris, told analysts that after discussions with the Chinese leadership “China is going to slow down coal-heavy investments” as it focuses on financial returns from investments. “I'm not confident at all that you're going to see [coal-to-olefins] or [methanol-to-olefins] off of coal coming in anywhere near the pace that was foreshadowed,” he said. The economics of capital-intensive coal-to-chemicals plants – which in recent years were tipped to boom in China – depend in large part on the oil price.(SNL)Chinese coal imports increase but bust looms:Chinese coal imports rose by about 17 per cent in October to just over 20 million tonnes, pushing the price of both thermal and metallurgical coal in the seaborne market to multi-year highs. In the first nine months of the year Chinese domestic production fell by about 300 million tonnes with imports rising by 23 million tonnes. With the Chinese Government urging accredited producers to rapidly increase production, analysts believe imports and prices will soon fall.(Reuters)Sacked Tata chairman complains of “aggressive” bidding on Indian project:In a blistering letter written after he was sacked as Chairman of the board of directors of the Tata Group, Cyrus Mistry complained Tata Power had “aggressively bid” for the 4000 MW Tata Mundra Ultra-Mega Power Project on the assumption of “low-priced Indonesian coal.” The magnitude of the losses, he wrote, “substantially depresses the return on capital for Tata Power as well as carries the risk of considerable future impairment.” Despite being sacked as Chairman, Mistry remains a director of major subsidiaries, is a major shareholder of the Tata Group and has branded his dismissal as illegal.(Financial Times,Financial Times)[Paywall]New Russian met coal project nears start:Tigers Realm Coal, a small Australian Stock Exchange listed company, plans to commission a cut-down version of its ‘Project F' metallurgical coal mine in Russia’s Far East in November.
