March 30, 2017Issue 176|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteThe shift away from coal continues – despite US President Donald Trump’s best efforts to hold the clean energy tide back. In Australia, the 1600 megawatt (MW)Hazelwoodcoal plant has finally closed, while inVietnamthe Ho Chi Minh City council is resisting a proposal for a polluting coal plant near the city. InJapanthe proposed 1000 MW Ichihara coal plant near Osaka has been scrapped while abig rallywas held in Seoul, South Korea against the proposed Danjin coal plant. In South Africa the scandal-plagued utilityEskomhas been rocked by revelations its CEO’s stepdaughter was the director of a company which won lucrative contracts, including on the new Kusile coal plant.Without doubt theTrump planto undo Obama Administration reforms on climate and energy policy has pleased coal companies and their lobbyists. However, there is no denying the structural challenge to coal power - withMoody’ssuggesting wind power is now so cheap in the US Great Plains states that many coal plants will be retired far earlier than previously thought. US coal use is set to keep going down; the only question now is how fast the decline will be.FeaturesClosure of old Australian coal plant illustrates need to plan ahead for a just transitionThe closure of the 1600 MWHazelwoodpower station in Victoria this week raises the question of whether the transition from coal power will be fast enough to avoid the worst risks to climate. There is also a need to plan ahead for a just transition to sustain regional communities,writesDr Nicholas Aberle in theGuardian.As #Hazelwood closes this week, we need a national plan to phase-out remaining #coal power stations https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/29/hazelwoods-closure-shows-companies-and-governments-must-plan-ahead-for-climate-changeOverlooked carbon costs could turn Western Balkans' new coal plants into white elephantsCountries in the Western Balkans – Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia – are planning new lignite plants that are likely to become uneconomic as soon as these countries join the European Union and have to pay a carbon price and compete in the European Union electricity market.

TonenGeneral Sekiyu and a subsidiary of Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO) attributed the decision to “changes in the feasibility and the surrounding environment”. The decision follows the Minister for Environment rejecting the environmental assessment of the project. Kiko Network has welcomed the decision as vindication of the growing movement against coal and renewed its call for all existing coal plants to be phased out.(Times of India,Kiko Network)As public opposition KEPCO dumps proposed 1000MW #coal plant as not being viable #Japan #climate @kimikohirata http://www.kikonet.org/eng/press-release-en/2017-03-23/Ichihara-cancelTop NewsHo Chi Minh City opposes coal plant on pollution grounds:Ho Chi Minh City’s(HCMC) People’s Committee, the city’s council, has objected to the risk of pollution posed by the proposed construction of a US$3.1 billion 1600 MW coal plant near the city. The former head of the Institute of HCMC Industry University’s Science, Technology and Environmental Management warned the pollution impact from the proposed plant would “be serious”. The plant has been proposed by Korean Electric Power Corporation and a local partner.(Vietnam.net,CoalSwarm)South Korean protest against coal plant:Over1500 peopleprotested against the proposal by the Korean private company SK to build a new 1160 MW coal plant in Dangjin City. In July 2016 a decision on the plant was deferred after a week-long hunger strike by residents who also objected to pollution from the nearby 6040 MWDangjin plant, one of the largest in the world.(EndCoal,CoalSwarm)Eskom CEO may face investigation over step-daughter’s business interests:The CEO ofEskom, Matshela Koko, may face an investigation by the Public Protector after revelations the project management company his 26-year old step-daughter worked for was awarded lucrative contracts by the utility. Koketso Choma, who graduated as an accountant three years ago, was appointed a director of Impulse International which subsequently landed over US$80 million in contracts by the division Koko headed at the time. The contracts included work on the Kusile coal plant which is under construction.(Sunday Times,South African Broadcasting Corporation)Australian mining lobby pushes for Asian coal coalition:The Minerals Council of Australia has proposed the Australian Government promote and support the creation of “an Asian Clean Energy Initiative around High Efficiency, Low Emissions (HELE) coal-fired power plants.” The coal industry lobby group proposed a “small number of key regional countries” launch the initiative and identified a “strong coincidence of interest” between Australia as a coal supplier, China and Japan as builders of coal plants and countries in South and South-East Asia seeking to increase power generation.(Minerals Council of Australia)Bulgaria seeks exemption from pollution control restrictions:The Bulgarian government is seeking an exemption from proposed European Union coal plant pollution standards designed to cut sulphur dioxide, mercury and nitrogen oxide emissions. The government claims the cost of upgrading polluting old coal plants could be US$556 million. Environmental groups argue Bulgaria, which has 35 coal generating units operating, should expand investment in renewables rather than seeking to prolong the life of the polluting plants.(Reuters)Global coal lobby says peak coal may be here:The head of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, has conceded “global coal demand is probably at a peak, in a way” though adding there may be some “slow growth” to 2040.  Following the revelation of a 48 per cent drop in pre-construction activity of coal plants in the past year, Sporton stated the cutbacks in China were“a signal of a more developed economy” and disputed that renewables were displacing coal in India.(CarbonBrief,World Coal Association)Trump signs energy order; coal companies applaud:PresidentDonald Trumphas signed an executive order seeking to unwind Obama Administration climate and energy policy reforms. The order rescinds the moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands, the use of a social cost of carbon in decision making, directed the gutting of the Clean Power Plan and requires a suite of reviews of regulations affecting the energy industry. However, most analysts argue the order will at worst slow the transition away from coal.(Washington Post,White House,Sierra Club)“Wind power economics are driving coal generation up the dispatch curve and into earlier retirement.

Moody’s estimates power purchase agreements for wind projects are about US$20 per Megawatt hour (MWh) after allowing for the US Government’s Production Tax Credit (PTC) while most coal-fired power generation in the region has operating costs over US$30/MWh.(Moody’s,GreenTechMedia)Contract signed for new Mozambique coal railway and port:Thai Mozambique Logistics (TML) – a joint venture 60% owned by Italian Thai Development – has awarded a US$2.3 billion construction contract to the Portuguese company Mota-Engil and China Civil Engineering Construction for the construction of a 500 kilometre long railway from the Moatize coalfields and a new port at Macuse. TML states the railway and new port are initially aiming to cater for 30 million tonnes of coal a year. Elsewhere, Vale has completed, pending the finalisation of finance, the sale of a 15 per cent stake in its Moatize mine and 35 per cent share of the company’s railway to Mitsui.(Macauhub,Reuters)Doubts raised over US CCS plant’s cost recovery:The sole Republican member on the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC), Sam Britton, has raised doubts that Mississippi Power will be entitled to recover the $2.88 billion previously specified as the limit of capital costs for the US$7.13 billion 582 MW Kemper CCS project. Cost recovery from the 186,000 consumers served by the project is only possible, Britton said, if the expenses were “prudent”. Mississippi Power is scheduled to submit its application to the MPSC in early June.(Watchdog)Mongolian miner reports losses:Mongolia Mining Corporation, which operates the Ukhaa Khudag mine in the Gobi desert, has reported losses of US$154.2 million in 2016 with total liabilities of $US921 million. The mine, which produced 1.5 million tonnes of coking coal for export to China, has touted plans to produce 78 million tonnes by 2018. However, the company notes that whether it can continue operations hinges on the restructuring of its debt. Earlier this decade Mongolia was touted as a major new global coal exporter.(Reuters,Mongolian Mining Corporation)ResourcesCarbon costs for planned coal power plants in the Western Balkans and the risk of stranded assets, BankWatch, March 29, 2017.
