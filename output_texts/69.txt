CoalWire: Coal's toxic effect on South Kalimantan; Germany to close some coal plants.December 5, 2014featuresCoal’s toxic effect on South Kalimantan“Something that sticks in my memory is the horrendous damage to the environment and landscape in Asam-asam, in South Kalimantan, in the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. Coal mining has been expanding extremely rapidly there, and in 2011 the region produced one-third of Indonesia’s coal. As coal production has increased, so have the negative impacts on the province’s people and environment,”writesArif Fiyanto from Greenpeace Southeast Asia.Suggested Tweet:The shocking story of toxic pollution from #coal mines in South Kalimantan #Indonesia http://bit.ly/1yhrxem @GreenpeaceSEAThe Queensland Government’s Great Barrier Reef give-away“In the last few weeks Queensland has offered Indian coal mining giant Adani a subsidy for its mine-to-port rail line with yet-to-be-raised taxpayer funds, thumbed its nose at international concern over mega-port development and told miners they no longer need licences to use gigalitres of groundwater,”writesFelicity Wishart from the Australian Marine Conservation Society in theNorthern Star.Suggested Tweet:Things worse than Obama thought for the Great Barrier #Reef writes Felicity Wishart from @AustMarConsSoc http://bit.ly/11QANNpChile’s Punta Alcalde coal plant postponed“Last month [communities opposing the proposed Punta Alcalde coal plant] were rewarded when an executive from Endesa’s parent company, Enel, announced that the plant would be suspended due to a lack of demand for the electricity. This lack of demand results from the community’s successful defeat of two controversial mining projects in the area: Pascua Lama and El Morro. As a result, there is no need for the electricity from Punta Alcalde. While this is good news for communities fighting the project, the war is far from over,”writesAviva Imhof inEndCoal.Suggested Tweet:#Chile’s Punta Alcalde #coal plant postponed but campaign not over http://bit.ly/1vLQ4Mx @avivaimhofcampaignsCourt rejects environmental impact assessment for Turkish coal plantA Turkish administrative court has rejected the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for a proposed US$2 billion coal power station slated to be built near Karabiga in Çanakkale.
