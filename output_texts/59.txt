CoalWire: Indian Supreme Court cancels 214 coal blocks; Could global emissions really peak?September 25, 2014As China and the US move away from coal could global emissions really peak?“For the past decade, the two biggest reasons for despair for those who favour strong action to stop climate change, and the top two excuses for those who don’t, have been the rapid increase in coal-burning in China and inaction in the US. But in the past few years, to the surprise of many, both these countries have taken major steps away from coal. Their move opens up a crucial window of opportunity to achieve what many thought was a lost cause – a peak in global emissions of heat-trapping gases well before 2020,”writesLauri Myllyvirta of Greenpeace International.Suggested Tweet:As #China and the US move away from #coal could global emissions really peak? writes @laurimyllyvirta @Energydesk #climateSerbia’s cross-border coal pollution under scrutiny by UN body“When it comes to coal, Serbia really doesn’t do things by halves. One of the coal-fired power plants that Serbia plans to build, Kostolac B3, is the first coal power plant to be under consideration by the United Nation’s Espoo Convention Implementation Committee for potentially breaching the Convention’s transboundary environmental impact assessment obligations. According to these a country is obliged to properly inform and consult neighbouring countries about transboundary environmental risks of projects it is promoting. So far, no coal power plants have ever been subject to consideration by the Committee,”writesIoana Ciuta, Bankwatch energy campaign coordinator.Suggested Tweet:#Serbia’s cross-border #coal pollution under scrutiny by UN body http://bit.ly/1qmlpwA #Kostolac B3 @unaltuserPeabody Coal 'Campaign' Hopefully Won't Fool Congress“As the world turns away from the dirty and destructive impacts of coal, and towards cleaner and safer non-fossil alternatives, it is little wonder that Peabody created a front organization to promote coal as ‘advanced’ and coal pollution as good ‘for life.’ Congress should reject Peabody's cynical public relations ploys and shadowy legislative tactics, and prevent OPIC's and Ex-Im Bank's corporate welfare for environmentally and developmentally harmful projects,”writesDoug Norlen from Friends of the Earth inHuffington Post.Suggested Tweet:#Peabody Energy 's Coal 'Campaign' Hopefully Won't Fool Congress http://huff.to/1pjQu44 @dougnorlencampaignsAfter climate rallies, the coal industry’s isolation growsIn what became the largest global climate day of protest, at least 600,000 people participated in 2800 events in 160 countries last weekend.
