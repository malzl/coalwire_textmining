January 12, 2017Issue 165|View Past IssuesEditor's Note2017 has barely begun yet around the world millions of people are grappling with major pollution events caused by coal power plants and other forms of coal burning. For days, Beijing and nearby cities were cloaked in a pall of toxic pollution which prompted authorities to promise to install air filtration systems in schools. In December the Polish city of Skala exceeded even Beijing’s pollution levels. Elsewhere air and water pollution from coal ash dumps has triggered a public backlash in the Philippines and Australia. In the US a study has revealed coal ash ponds at a closed coal plant in Virginia are stored almost two metres below sea level and vulnerable to storm surges and flooding.Despite these grim events there has been some good news. In the US a Washington state agency has refused to approve a vital lease for the proposed Longview coal terminal while the latest power generation statistics reveal the dramatic dethroning of King Coal in Britain.FeaturesChina’s new power plan boosts renewables and poses more challenges for coalWhile targets for renewables in China’s recently-released national energy sector plan are likely to be exceeded, as they were in 2016, challenges remain in ensuring priority access to the grid for wind and solar energy,writesLauri Myllyvirta inEnergyDesk.#China’s #renewables growth & #coal cuts outpaced 2016 targets @laurimyllyvirta #climate http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/05/31/china-is-hitting-its-climate-targets-years-ahead-of-schedule/The year coal collapsed: 2016 was a turning point for Britain’s electricityIn 2016 Britain’s electricity became the cleanest it had been in 60 years, as coal power collapsed and renewable power generation rose to record levels,writeGrant Wilson from the University of Sheffield andIain Staffellfrom Imperial College London inThe Conversation.The year #coal collapsed: 2016 was a turning point for #Britain’s electricity @DrIAGWilson #renewables #climate http://theconversation.com/the-year-coal-collapsed-2016-was-a-turning-point-for-britains-electricity-70877CampaignsWashington state refuses lease for Columbia River coal terminalWashington State’s retiringCommissionerof Public Lands, Peter Goldmark, has ruled out sub-leasing state-owned aquatic lands to Millennium Bulk Terminals for its proposed 44 million tonnes a year coal export terminal on the Columbia River. Goldmark cited “a chronic pattern of failure by the company to provide essential and accurate information.” He also announced the addition of 18 hectares to the Cherry Point Aquatic Reserve near Bellingham, which had been requested by the Lummi Indian Business Council which opposes the use of the site for the proposed Longview coal export terminal. The announcements have been welcomed by tribal and environmental groups.(The News & Observer,Department of Natural Resources)Top NewsAir pollution disasters in Poland, China:In December the Polish city of Skala recorded air pollution levels 20 times higher than European Union limits and had worse air quality than Beijing.In 2016 Poland had 33 of Europe’s 50 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In Beijing, three weeks of heavy smog prompted public protests at its effect on children, forcing government authorities to vow to install air filtration systems in schools. Despite cuts to nearby coal plant capacity the smog was rated as the longest run of days in 15 years with PM2.5 air pollution above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. The WHO recommended limit is 25 micrograms per cubic metre over a 24-hour period.(Financial Times [paywall],Washington Post)Public alarm at coal ash pollution in Philippines and Australia:The San Miguel Consolidated Power Corporation (SMC) has been ordered to clean up bottom ash polluting the coastline near the 150 MW coal plant it operates at a major oil refinery and petrochemical complex. SMC is also currently constructing a 600 MW plant at Limay in Bataan province. In South Australia strong summer winds have blown coal ash across the city of Port Augusta from the 250 hectare disposal site at the recently closed Flinders Power station, prompting community protests.(InterAksyon,ABC News)Virginia coal ash dumps vulnerable to sea level rise:A report by the Western Carolina University and commissioned by the Southern Environmental Law Center has found that almost 3 million tonnes of coal ash stored at the closed Chesapeake Energy Center site in Virginia is “highly vulnerable to coastal hazards, including flooding, storm surge, erosion and sea level rise.” The coal ash is buried almost 2 metres below sea level. Dominion Virginia Power is being sued by the Sierra Club which is seeking the removal of the coal ash and disposal at a more secure inland site.(The Virginian-Pilot,Western Carolina University)Vietnamese Ministry rejects coal plant bid to clear protected areas:The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development recently rejected a provincial government proposal to clear 1000 hectares of the Hon Cau Marine Protected Area to make room for the expansion of the controversial 6224 megawatt (MW) Vinh Tan Power Complex.(Vietnamnet)Villagers resist water grab for Pakistan coal plant:A hunger strike by villagers entered its third month in protest against the clearing of thousands of trees and the environmental and social impacts of a proposed 600 hectare Thar coal project’s wastewater storage plan. The proposed dam has alarmed tribal groups concerned about the impact on groundwater resources and the dispossession of villagers from their lands without adequate compensation.(Dawn,Dawn)Legal challenge to Indonesian coal plant begins:A legal challenge has commenced against a decision by the West Java provincial government to grant an environment permit for the proposed 1000 MW expansion of the Cirebon plant. Lawyers for six individuals argue the proposed plant and associated infrastructure are proposed in an area zoned for fishermen and shrimp farmers which have already been adversely affected by the operation of the existing 660 MW Cirebon plant.(Wahli)NewsIndia:Courtapprovescharges against Himachal EMTA Power, three company directors and a government official over allocation of Gourangdih ABC coal block in West Bengal.Germany:Lignite and black coal power productionfellin 2016 by 0.8 and 1.2 per cent respectively.Russia:Coal productiongrewby over nine per cent in 2016 to 384 million tonnes; exports up by 16.4 per cent to 163.6 million tonnes.US:CCS unit to capture 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a yearcommissionedto boost oil production in Texas oilfield.US:Bowie Resource Partners abandons plan for coal gasification for power and diesel at Colorado mine.US:RegulatorblocksHawaiian Electric Company from buying extra coal power from AES’s coal plant.Companies + MarketsSociete Generale drops Indonesian coal plant:Societe Generale, a major French bank, has confirmed to Friends of the Earth France that it will not finance the proposed 2140 MW expansion of Tanjung Jati B-2 coal plant in Central Java in Indonesia.
