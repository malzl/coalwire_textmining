October 4, 2018Issue 248|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteMembers of the United Nations International Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are meeting in Incheon, South Korea, this week to discuss their findings for holding global warming to 1.5℃, the target set by the Paris climate agreement. Meeting the target will require much deeper cuts in the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, according to IPCC scientists.In the US,the Trump Administration is preparing to roll back emissions of mercury from power plants, and is desperately trying to salvage the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh who, in 2014, wrote in a dissenting opinion that most health benefits should not be considered when considering the value of environmental regulations. If confirmed, Kavanaugh could provide the decisive vote in future cases challenging Trump’s rollbacks of Obama-era environmental regulations.Energy surpluses spell trouble for coal producers in India,while in South Africa and Kosovo, bankers are backing off proposed coal projects. And South Chungcheong Province in South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance.—James Browning, CoalSwarmFeaturesIPCC to recommend much deeper cuts in coal burningAccording to an international panel of climate scientists, keeping global warming to 1.5℃ will require utilities by 2030 to burn a third as much coal as they do now,writesJeremy Hodges inBloomberg.To hold global warming to 1.5°C, we have to reduce global #coal use by two-thirds over the next 12 years – a decline over twice as steep as the boldest scenario outlined by the IEA.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-30/coal-pollution-gets-much-deeper-cut-ipcc-report-on-climate-changeTrump Administration to roll back regulation of mercury emissionsA plan to undo Obama-era regulations of mercury emissions from power plants is being prepared by the Trump Administration’s EPA Director (and former coal lobbyist) Andrew Wheeler,writesCoral Davenport forThe New York Times.Trump proposal to repeal consideration of health benefits when regulating toxic pollution such as #mercury, making such regulations easier to overturn as overly burdensome on industry. If confirmed, #Kavanaugh would likely uphold the change. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/climate/epa-trump-mercury-rule.htmlOpposition likely defeats 2,800 MW coal plant in Vietnam Long An ProvinceThe plan to build a 2,800-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant in Long An southern province near Ho Chi Minh City is likely to be cancelled due to the provincial leadership’s opposition,writesTrung Chanh inThe Saigon Times.CampaignsSeason of Clean Energy in the PhilippinesEnvironmental groups in the Philippinesmarkedthe Catholic Church's “Season of Creation” in September with week-long demonstrations against dirty energy sources in the country. Residents from communities near coal mines held simultaneous protest rallies in different parts of the country to dramatize their call for the government to end its “coal obsession.”(UCA News)Top NewsJapan’s Prime Minister calls for reduction in fossil fuel use:Shinzo Abe wrote inThe Financial Timesthat Japan must reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, yet Japan is the only G7 country still planning new coal-fired power stations, with more than 17 generating units in the planning stage and 15 under construction. After China, Japan is also the largest public funder of coal-fired plants, investing US$14.5 billion over the past five years.(Business Green)World Bank reconsiders financing of Kosovo coal plant:The World Bank may withdraw support for a proposed 500 MW coal plant in Kosovo, the last coal project in the bank’s project pipeline that is not subject to its 2013 moratorium on coal project finance. The Kosovar government had signed a deal with US-based ContourGlobal in 2017 to build the plant at a cost of around €1 billion, but the bank is now finalising a study that will compare investment in coal to other options before choosing whether to provide finance for the project.(Reuters,Bretton Woods Project)South Korea province joins coal phase out alliance:South Chungcheong Province, which is home to half of South Korea's coal power generation, has joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, becoming its first member in Asia.With 18 gigawatts of coal power, the province is the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance. The government is reportedly responding to concerns from local residents over air pollution.(NRDC)Kavanaugh confirmation to US Supreme Court threatens environmental protections:While working to roll back regulations of mercury emissions, the Trump Administrationis also desperately trying to salvage the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who once argued that any health or environmental side benefits resulting from the rule (such as reductions in deaths due to lower particulate emissions) must be excluded from the cost/benefit analysis. If confirmed, Kavanaugh could provide the decisive vote in future cases challenging Trump’s rollbacks of Obama-era regulations.(The New Republic,Environmental Working Group)Hambach Forest Protesters Evicted:As German police continue their crackdown on protesters occupying the Hambach Forest, activists called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to intervene and prevent the forest’s destruction. A lawyer for Greenpeace argued that “there is no existing law that allows RWE to clear Hambach Forest under any circumstances, at any time and to any extent.” RWE is seeking to expand its adjacent coal lignite mine.(Deutsche Welle,Focus)“We are on the edge and the climate impacts that scientists warned us about decades ago are here. . .
