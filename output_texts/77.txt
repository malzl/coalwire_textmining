The case, which was brought by the Bankwatch network, challenged the move by Oltenia Energy Complex to seek permits for numerous areas under one hectare thereby allowing the regional forestry agency to approve forest clearing. Areas over 10 hectares require a decision of the government and an environmental impact statement. Bankwatch Romania has another eight similar legal actions before the courts over forest permits around nine lignite pits.(Bankwatch)Suggested Tweet:Romanian court overturns #forest clearing permits for #coal mine expansion http://bit.ly/1CceJrx @ceebankwatch“We believe that thermal coal will not go through another full iteration of the commodity cycle: the high prices to incentivize large-scale investment [in] greenfield mines and infrastructure will not return,”wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a January 2015 report titled‘Thermal coal reaches retirement age’.
