This is not an uncommon challenge, and is often best addressed by outside parties invited by the authorities to observe, report and enforce change … An external investigation of illegal coal shipping in Indonesia could go a long way to establishing a strong basis for establishing honest reform,”writesTom Sanzillo from theInstitute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.Suggested Tweet:#Indonesia’s #coal-trafficking problem requires impartial inquiry @ieefa_institute's Tom Sanzillo in Jakarta Globe http://bit.ly/1eiqFE8Will Vietnam avoid becoming a dumping ground for China’s coal plant builders?“The news that coal consumption [in China] is now falling, while welcomed by environmentalists, has consequences for a number of other countries, including Vietnam … Vietnam and other countries that have significant economic ties with China are at risk of becoming dumping grounds for coal. They should adopt stricter policies to avoid becoming locked into coal-based development and ending up where China was a few years ago. They need to leapfrog this phase and follow China's lead by reducing their dependence on coal,”writesMaarten Akkerman in International Institute for Environment and DevelopmentSuggested Tweet:Will #Vietnam avoid becoming a dumping ground for #China’s #coal plant builders? @mjakkerman http://bit.ly/1Bik1Yy pic.twitter.com/aT7N9ccacjtop newsBig cuts in air pollution needed to reduce death rates:A study has found that substantial cuts in outdoor air pollution would be required just to stabilise deaths caused by PM2.5 fine particle pollution. The study’s authors estimated that without any change to current air pollution levels in China and India the deaths per capita from air pollution would increase by between 20 to 30 per cent during the next 15 years. Coal burning is a significant contributor to PM2.5 pollution.(News Medical,Environmental Science & Technology)‘Dirty dozen’ coal investors with global bootprint:A dozen individuals with major coal investments control deposits containing the equivalent of China’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to aGuardiananalysis.

The theory is that as Indonesia ramps up domestic coal-fired power generation, it will rotate its exports to meet local demand, thereby removing millions of tonnes from the seaborne market and bringing it back into balance … But white knights have had a somewhat chequered recent history for coal producers and traders,”writesClyde Russell inReuters.companies + marketsEmployees sue US coal companies for not divesting:Former US employees of Arch Coal and Peabody Energy are suing the companies alleging they breached fiduciary duties by keeping employee retirement funds invested in the company’s own declining stocks.
