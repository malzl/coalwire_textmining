The IEA estimates 90 per cent of the increased deaths would occur in Asia. The IEA suggests the death toll could be cut by stricter pollution controls on coal-fired power plants, the increased use of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency.(Reuters,RenewEconomy)North Carolina’s sweetheart deal on Duke Energy’s coal ash dams:The North Carolina legislature is set to pass legislation ensuring there will be no independent commission monitoring Governor McCrory’s regulation of Duke Energy’s coal ash dams.
