April 5, 2018Issue 223|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteAs the economic viability of coal power continues to decline, opposition to coal power and mining is flourishing. InIndonesiaa community in South Kalimantan has launched a legal challenge against a proposed coal mine. InVietnam, a member of parliament has publicly opposed the construction of further coal plants. InSouth Africa, the recent dumping of President Zuma has opened up new opportunities for the country to pivot away from expensive coal towards ever cheaper renewables. In addition, two proposed coal plants in South Africa are beingchallengedbefore the energy regulator and one in the courts. InAustralia, a poll has revealed majority support for the world’s largest thermal coal exporter to join Powering Past Coal Alliance in aiming to phase out coal power by 2030.Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s (BNEF) latestassessmentof power generation costs argues the combination of wind, solar and battery storage is fast eroding the economic viability of both coal and gas even in countries such as India. In South America,Engiewill shortly unveil plans to phase out most of its existing coal plants and replace the capacity with renewables. And elsewhere, coal power and mining companies are in distress. InPakistan,India, theUSandSouth Africa, coal consumers are looking to governments for financial relief from the costs of flawed business decisions that assumed coal power and mining would be viable for a long time to come.FeaturesSouth Kalimantan indigenous residents resist a coal invasionResidentsand the environmental group Walhi have launched legal action against the Indonesian government for permitting a proposed coal mine despite the lack of any environmental impact statement,writesIan Morse inMongabay.Upheavals provide opportunity for Eskom to embrace renewablesTheappointmentof President Cyril Ramaphosa has created the opportunity for South Africa to embrace renewables instead of the expensive coal and nuclear plants pushed by former President Jacob Zuma and his supporters,writesHartmut Winkler, Professor of Physics at theUniversity of Johannesburg, in The Conversation.Top NewsVietnamese MP opposes more coal plants:A member ofVietnam’slegislative body National Congress, Le Cong Nhuong, has publicly opposed the proposal to seek Chinese funding for the Quang Trach 2 coal-fired power plant in his Quang Binh province. “We should not seek funds from China and should not build more coal-fired power plants,” he said.

The groups and the Center for Environmental Rights also argued before the National Energy Regulator of South Africa that applications for generation licences for the proposed Thabametsi project and the 300 MW Khanyisa plant should be rejected. The Minister for Energy, Jeff Radebe, has signed 27 power purchase agreements for renewable energy projects after the High Court rejected an application by a mining union to block the new contracts.(Center for Environmental Rights,Engineering News)Poll reveals majority support for Australian coal phase-out:Anopinion pollof 1417 Australians has found that 60 per cent of respondents supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance comprising countries that agree to phase out coal power without carbon capture and storage by 2030. If Australia backed the alliance, which was founded by Canada and the UK, it would be the first major thermal coal exporter to join. The poll was undertaken in early December for the Australia Institute, a progressive think tank.(Guardian,Australia Institute)Engie flags closure of Chile coal plants:In thenextfew weeks the French utility Engie will reveal details of its plan to close its 778 MW of existing coal plants in Chile. The company said it plans to replace them with renewable capacity and use its existing gas plants as back up. Engie considered the option of selling its coal plants but decided it would not get a good price in the current market and would also lose its customer base. “Our customers are also interested in moving to green energy,” said Philip De Cnudde, Engie’s CEO. A new 375 MW coal unit at the Mejillones power station is currently under construction and due to be commissioned in mid-2018.(Bloomberg,Bloomberg,CoalSwarm)European lignite emissions rise as coal falls:European Commission data reveal that greenhouse gas emissions from hard coal plants fell by eight per cent across the 28 member countries in the European Union. However, with greenhouse gas emissions from lignite plants rising by three per cent in 2017, total power section emissions fell by only one per cent despite the rapid expansion of renewables. While lignite emissions fell by one per cent in Germany, they grew in Poland, the Czech Republic, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Spain.(Sandbag)Coal ship at centre of Indonesian investigation of deadly oil spill:Indonesian authorities are investigating the possibility that the source of a major oil spill and fire which killed four fishermen in Balikpapan Bay was a Panamanian-registered coal carrier, the MV Ever Judger. The oil slick has spread across the bay with the fire sending thick black smoke across the city. Authorities have taken samples of the ship’s bunker fuel for tests. Indonesian oil company Pertamina, which operates a refinery in Balikpapan, argues the oil spill was of diesel fuel oil not crude oil from the refinery.(Radio Australia)“I think that coal in the next 30 years — we will see that it will go very much out of the energy mix more and more,”saidRiccardo Puliti, the World Bank's global head of energy and extractives.“I think that #coal in the next 30 years — we will see that it will go very much out of the energy mix more and more,” says Riccardo Puliti, the #WorldBank's global head of #energy and extractives. #lignite https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/01/coal-use-will-drastically-decline-in-the-next-30-years-the-world-bank-predicts.htmlNewsAustralia:Government datarevealspollution from coal plants and mines increased over the last year.Australia:NSW Governmentchallengedto reveal details of negotiations over proposed Shenhua mine.China:Fujian province temporarilybansforeign imports into the port of Luoyan.India:Lobby group for private power producersopposesNTPC’s contract to supply power to Bangladesh.Kenya:Courtrejectsone of two legal challenges against Chinese-back coal plant.Netherlands:German utility Uniperdemandscompensation for early closure of Maasvlakte coal plant.Poland:Australian companysuesMinistry of Environment to grant licence for Jan Karski project.Companies + MarketsBloomberg says renewables eating case for coal:ABNEFreport on the levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) of major electricity technologies finds that coal and gas generation is facing an “unprecedented challenge” from the rapidly falling cost of wind, solar and battery storage. [LCOE is one technique for comparing the cost of power generation across a wide range of technologies.] BNEF estimates the cost of coal power in India is US$68 per megawatt hour (MWh), compared to onshore wind at $US39 per MWh and solar at US$41 per MWh. In India the cost of onshore wind has fallen by 66 per cent over the last year while solar power has dropped by 45 per cent.(Bloomberg,RenewEconomy)Indian private power lobby calls for stressed plants bailout:Ashok Khurana, Director General of Association of Power Producers (APP), which represents companies including Adani Power, Essar and Reliance Power, has conceded that “anytime” the cost of thermal coal on the global market goes higher than US$70 per tonne, imported coal power plants “become unaffordable and cannot be dispatched.” APP wants banks to write off about 70 per cent of the value of loans to private power developers, public utilities to take over Tata and Adani’s stressed Mundra plants and the finances of distribution utilities to be restored to enable prompt payment for power.(MoneyControl.com)Coal India plans to cut inventory and boost solar:Coal India produced 567 million tonnes of coal in the 2017–18 financial year to the end of March, a 2.4 per cent increase on the year before. While the publicly owned company had a target of 600 million tonnes, it reduced production to allow large stockpiles to be cleared before they deteriorated further. The company sold just over 580 million tonnes in the year, with stockpiles reduced to just over 55 million tonnes. New mines producing 25 million tonnes were commissioned and a further 21 projects are slated to add a further 43 million tonnes capacity in 2018–19.
