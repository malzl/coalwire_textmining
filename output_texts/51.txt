CoalWire: Indian crackdown on Mahan activists; China’s coal industry hits tough times.July 31, 2014Indian police try to shut down Mahan forests campaignAfter midnight on July 30, Indian police entered Greenpeace’s Waidhan guesthouse near Mahan without a warrant, questioned five Greenpeace activists and arrested two. Earlier in the day police confiscated all communication equipment from the Greenpeace office as well as solar panels used to power the communications equipment. The raid is the latest move in increasing repression aimed at anti-coal activists in India, and in particular at opposition to Essar Energy’s proposed coal mine at Mahan in Madhya Pradesh.Background on the campaign ishereandhere, a Greenpeace blog post detailing the raid and arrestshereand a sign-on emailhere.Suggested Tweets:Indian police try to muzzle protests against @Essar #Mahan #coal mine http://bit.ly/1le7IyR Protest letter http://bit.ly/1rQIHB8 #IamMahanCoastal Indian coal plants playing havoc with water suppliesThe Indian government plans for the establishment of several ‘ultra-mega’ power projects – each with a capacity of over 4000 megawatts (MW) – in coastal locations and based on imported coal assumed water supply wasn’t an issue. “The assumption that locating such plants on the coast will take care of the water problems related to coal-based power has proved quite unrealistic, and exposed it as being based on a lack of understanding and assessments of the coastal hydrology and ecology,”writesShripad Dharmadhikary, the co-ordinator of Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, a research group on water and energy issues. These plants and associated infrastructure are “playing havoc with local hydrological systems and the lives and livelihoods of communities which are closely associated with water.”Suggested Tweet:Coastal Indian ‘ultra-mega’ #coal plants “playing havoc with local hydrological systems and the lives and livelihoods of communities” http://bit.ly/1mTyagJcampaignsUK Council rejects proposed coal mineDurham County Council’s planning committee rejected an application by UK Coal Surface Mines for an open cut coal mine after local community opposition. The company proposed to produce a million tonnes of coal from farmland straddling two councils. While the Gateshead Council approved the project, objections from residents over the impacts of the mine and truck traffic saw Durham’s planning committee reject it. “It’s a gorgeous part of the world and it’s fine as it is. The community don’t want it and as far as I am concerned, the only people who are going to benefit are UK Coal,” said Councillor Carl Marshall.(Northern Echo)top newsAustralian Government approves Galilee Basin mega-mine:The Australian government has approved Adani’s proposed 60 million tonne a year Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin in Queensland. The mine requires a new railway and the expansion of the Abbot Point coal terminal adjoining the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. However, doubts remain that the company can finance the US$15.5 billion project. Tim Buckley from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis suggested that “maybe it's a question that they don't want to have to write off the $525 million that they paid to buy the right to proceed with this project.”(Guardian,ABC Radio)UK’s plan to subsidise capacity market approved by European Union:The European Union has approved a proposal by the British Government to establish a ‘capacity market’ to subsidise sufficient generation capacity to meet demand. The proposal has been criticised by environmental groups as it allows for subsidies for existing coal and gas plants and delays a transition away from carbon intensive power generation. Greenpeace argues that the government should instead focus on demand management, improved interconnectors with Europe and increased storage capacity.(Reuters,Greenpeace UK)Serbia increases power imports to offset flooded mine:The flooding of the Kolubara mine is likely to cost the Serbian power industry US$660 million, according to a report by the European Union, the World Bank and the UN. Lignite from the mine is used to generate half the country’s electricity. To make up the shortfall, power has been imported from neighbouring countries. The Kolbura mine was flooded with 187 million cubic meters of water and silt in May.(Bloomberg)Former Japanese power executive reveals donations to PMs:The former Vice-President of Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO), Chimori Naito, has revealed that between 1972 and 1989 seven Japanese Prime Ministers were paid approximately US$200,000 a year by the company. The donations were, he said, “simply one way for electric power companies to act toward public authority that had control over approval of business matters. We hoped it would work like Chinese herbal medicine and take effect after prolonged use.”(Asahi Shimbun)Modi promotes upgrading small inefficient plants:The Indian government is proposing to encourage small old coal plants with a combined capacity of 25,000 MW to upgrade to super-critical coal plants by offering them guaranteed coal supply for any additional capacity. While unclear, it was inferred that new environmental approvals and water allocations would not be required.(Financial Express)Public hearings on proposed EPA power plant rule:A total of 1600 people are scheduled to give testimony at public hearings this week on the proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule on limits to power plant emissions. Over 300,000 public comments have been submitted on the rule, which is proposed to be finalised early next year. Ahead of the hearings the Obama administration released a report by the Council of Economic Advisers arguing that for each decade of delay in taking action on climate change that costs would increase by 40 per cent.(Guardian,Washington Post)“Many leaders think that the coal mines in particular will continue to suffer, with coal prices hitting an all-time low and with an over-supply of coal.

Imagine what you will say in 40 years’ time when you are asked if you were there,”wroteJonathan Moylan, an Australian activist who was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison, suspended on condition of good behaviour for two years for having distributed a bogus press release claiming that the ANZ Bank had withdrawn a $1.2 billion loan for the Maules Creek mine in New South Wales.companies + marketsTeck argues for more met coal cuts:The Chief Executive of Teck, Don Lindsay, said that while 20 million tonnes of production cuts of metallurgical coal have been announced, only three million tonnes had actually been withdrawn from the market with the balance due to take effect early next year. Teck is the world’s second largest exporter seaborne metallurgical coal, after BHP Billiton. “With such a huge percentage of the industry operating in a cash negative basis we do anticipate that the 10 million tonnes of further reductions that we think are needed will occur. We just can't predict the timing,” he said.(Reuters)China’s coal industry hits tough times:The chairman of the China National Coal Association, Wang Xianzheng, has urged domestic coal producers to cut production by 10% in the second half of the year “otherwise the market could worsen further.” He also wants the government to impose restrictions on the use of imported coal with ash more than 16 per cent and sulphur above 1 per cent in coastal metropolitan areas. Xianzheng said that more than 70 per cent of Chinese coal companies were making losses.(Platts)India coal group to buy Rio Tinto’s Mozambique mines:International Coal Ventures – a consortium of Indian government-owned steel, coal and power generators – is negotiating to buy three coal projects from Rio Tinto for US$50 million. In 2011 Rio Tinto paid US$3.7 billion for Riversdale Mining, which owned the projects. Subsequently Rio Tinto discovered that the Benga Mining project contained less metallurgical coal than expected, while the Mozambican government rejected a plan to barge coal down the Zambezi River.(RenewEconomy,CoalSwarm)Indian distributors likely to challenge power price order:State electricity distribution companies for Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab and Rajasthan are likely to appeal against a ruling awarding increased power prices to Tata Power and Adani Power due to the unanticipated additional costs of Indonesian coal.
