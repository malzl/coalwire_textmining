CoalWire: Tough times for US coal lobby; IPCC head sidesteps coal as energy poverty solution.July 3, 2014Germany ponders the energy revolution required to keep coal in the ground“Hailed by environmentalists as a model for how the world's nations can stop global warming, Germany's Energiewende is designed to virtually eliminate emissions and convert 60% of the country's energy production to renewables by 2050. But as the concept catches on in nations like China – which now leads the world in green power capacity and investment in renewables – cracks are emerging in the foundations, suggesting focusing on renewables will not be enough… In the short term that means grid-preference for flexible but reliable natural gas-power plants instead of cheaper lignite, as well as subsidies for electricity stored in batteries or converted to hydropower or hydrogen,”writesJason Overdorf inChina Dialogue.Suggest Tweet:The next phase of the German energy revolution will be to keep #coal in the ground http://bit.ly/TvF9oUThe US Coal Lobby's Fight for Survival“For a century, coal dominated America's energy landscape, cheaply fuelling the factories of the Rust Belt and lighting up homes across the country. King Coal also enjoyed almost unrivalled influence in Washington. On Capitol Hill, the muscular coal lobby routinely rolled its opponents. In particular, the clout of the coal lobby—and the money it doled out—was a major reason Congress has never enacted a serious climate-change law. Now all that's changing. Coal is under siege from forces beyond its control. Its dominant place in the American economy is slipping—and so, for the first time in a century, is its ability to get what it wants from Washington,”writesCoral Davenport in theNational Journal.Suggested Tweet:The US #Coal Lobby "now lies in disarray at the mercy of forces beyond its control" http://bit.ly/1qy05aU @nationaljournaltop newsIPCC head sidesteps coal as an energy poverty solution:In an address to the United Nations in India, the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Dr Rajendra Pachauri, argues for the “decarbonization of electricity generation” but notably did not embrace the coal industry’s claim that new coal-fired plants are needed to address energy poverty. Instead, Pachauri endorsed renewables, increased energy efficiency and the “replacement of world average coal-fired power plants with modern natural gas combined-cycle power plants.” He also tentatively endorsed carbon capture and storage but noted it had challenges “and risks”.(United Nations in India,Dr Pachauri)Proposed new Australian export terminal heads for public hearing:Plans for a new 70 million-tonnes-per-annum (Mtpa) coal export terminal in Newcastle will be subject to a Planning Assessment Commission review within weeks.

The publicly-owned power utility operates 12 power stations in the region and is currently seeking the deferral of air pollution standards. Deferring Eskom’s need for compliance, says groundWork, would “in many cases” be “effectively exemption” from the standards.(News24,groundWork)Judge blocks coal exploration plan:A US District Court judge has overturned decisions by the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approving a coal exploration program by Arch Coal in the Sunset Roadless Area in Western Colorado.
