655,000 Chinese to be displaced by mine subsidence; Balkan coal rush; Peabody campaign outed.May 21, 2015View this email in your browserThe Truth Behind Peabody's Campaign to Rebrand Coal as a Poverty Cure“The story Linda Jing tells in the video is slick and persuasive: she was a girl from a poor village forced to study by candlelight because there was no electricity until coal-fired power plants arrived, transforming her destiny and that of China. … The message in the Linda Jing video is clear – coal is the solution to poverty in developing nations. It is Peabody’s bold attempt to change the conversation away from climate change, and it has embraced it with gusto on its Advanced Energy for Life website,”writesSuzanne Goldenburg in theGuardian.Suggested Tweet:The truth behind @PeabodyEnergy's campaign to rebrand #coal as a poverty cure http://bit.ly/1HfoLdY @suzyjiIt’s Time for Norway’s Pension Fund to Divest More of Its Coal Holdings“The global coal industry has become an increasingly risky investment unfit for any investment fund with a fiduciary duty to those it serves … the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global has made strides over the years in divesting from coal, but our research indicates that the fund’s managers have not gone far enough. Coal holdings are simply too risky to own in this day and age. The industry is arguably the poorest-performing sector in the world and is in a state of deep structural decline simply because coal markets are not what they used to be. Nor will they likely recover,”writesTom Sanzillo from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Suggested Tweet:Global #coal industry unfit for any investment fund - time for Norway’s Pension Fund to #divest http://bit.ly/1IL3jlc @ieefa_instituteBalkan Coal Rush Risks Lasting Damage“Balkan countries and Ukraine are making ‘substantial investments’ in polluting coal power stations to sell cheap electricity to the European Union (EU), as the bloc searches for new suppliers to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. EU officials appear reluctant to use energy negotiations next month, or trade law, to force higher air pollution and environmental standards, despite the risks the rush poses to EU climate change and enlargement policies, and to finances and public health in the Balkans,”writesJames Crisp inEurActiv.Suggested Tweet:#Balkans #coal rush risks risks EU #climatechange policies, finances & public #health http://bit.ly/1PSKKvR @JamesCrisp6top newsHuge subsidies for coal, says IMF:A working paper by International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff says that in 2015 energy subsidies amounted to US$5.3 trillion, noting that “coal accounts for the biggest subsidies, given its high environmental damage and because (unlike for road fuels) no country imposes meaningful excises on its consumption.” The IMF says the subsidies account for about 6.5 per cent of global gross domestic product and “likely exceed government health spending across the world.”(International Monetary Fund,International Monetary Fund)Indian Supreme Court castigates corruption agency head:The Supreme Court has described as “completely inappropriate” meetings between Ranjit Sinha, the then head of the Central Bureau of Investigation, and executives of companies under investigation in the ‘Coalgate’ scandal without investigating officers being present.

Duke Energy still faces lawsuits by citizens groups over leaking coal ash dams at 14 sites in North Carolina.(New York Times,Southern Environmental Law Center)Mass relocation due to subsidence in Chinese coal province:Over 655,000 people in 1352 villages will be relocated in the coal mining province of Shanxi due to the problems caused by subsidence following underground mining operations. Underground coal mining has affected over 5000 square kilometres of the province, damaging houses, water supplies and farmlands, according to Xinhua news agency.(ECNS.com)German Government ponders easing proposed emissions rule:In response to lobbying by power utilities RWE and Vattenfall, some unions and coal-belt politicians, the German Government is considering softening its proposed carbon levy on emissions from old coal plants. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy has proposed cutting the reduction target for the coal power sector by over a quarter to 16 million tonnes by 2020. The changes, the ministry document states, would “improve the economic viability of old power stations.”(Clean Energy Wire)Pollution spikes as power plants turn off pollution controls:Power plant operators in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia have turned off emissions control equipment due to the availability of cheap tradeable pollution credits. While New Jersey residents suffer from the health impacts associated with high ozone levels caused by nitrogen oxide emissions from neighbouring states, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s ‘cap and trade’ policy allows plants to continue to pollute if they buy credits from less polluting plants.(NorthJersey.com)“Coal demand in China has peaked … It went down last year, it's probably going down even more this year.

While promoting the use of market forces to set prices, draft documents also indicate the intent to promote renewable energy and cut dirty coal plants. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that three gigawatts of coal capacity will replace each gigawatt retired between now and 2020, half the rate of the last five years. Plant utilisation rates have fallen to the lowest level since 1978 with further decline likely this year.(Wall Street Journal,The Business Times)Coal India unveils plan for doubling production:The Minister for Coal and Energy, Piyush Goyal, has revealed that in order for Coal India to meet the government’s goal of doubling domestic coal production by 2019-2020 it would need an additional 70 to 100 new mines, predominantly in Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Such an expansion hinges on three major new railway connections and an investment of US$20 to US$25 billion. Goyal reiterated his view that increasing domestic production would “substitute for imports of thermal coal in the next two and a half years.”(Business Standard,Economic Times)US bill proposes moratorium on new federal coal leases:Democratic Senator Edward Markey has proposed a bill requiring a moratorium on new coal leases on federal land until the Department of Interior completes a ‘fair market’ analysis of the value of the coal.

In the first quarter of 2015 Polish hard coal production fell just over 8 per cent, with production by the state-owned company Kompania Weglowa falling by 17 per cent and the privately-owned Bogdanka dropping by 11.5 per cent.(The News,Platts)Banks launch legal action against Russian coal miner:Two Russian banks – the privately-owned Sberbank and the state-owned VTB – have  launched legal action over unpaid debts by Mechel, a major Russian metallurgical coal producer.
