August 24, 2017Issue 196|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteThe rapid erosion of the viability of existing coal plants has spurred a desperate lobbying blitz by the coal industry for increased subsidies and protection from competition. Bob Murray, a Trump donor and supporter,demandedthe protection of one of his biggest customers; the Trump Administration said no.Peabody Energyis hoping a new railway line – with the funder so far unspecified – will keep one of its mines viable. In thePhilippines, a Senator has raised the question as to why a regulator would consider approving 20-year coal power purchase agreements when solar costs are already cheaper and falling. InChina, the government’s debt-for equity swaps were supposed to exclude “zombie” firms in the overcapacity coal and steel sectors but increasingly they are by-passing the restrictions.Just as the industry is trying to avoid economic reality, it also seeks to avoid accepting environmental liability. In theBalkans, new coal plants are being proposed which won’t conform to new European Union pollution control rules. In the US the Trump Administration has axed astudyinto the health impacts of mountaintop mining. InThailand, the assessment of a major new coal plant is being pushed with limited public input. In Australia, new results reveal major pollution ofSydney’s water catchmentby mothballed coal mines and huge water losses from river catchments into existing underground mines.FeaturesThe lights are dimming on King Coal’s hold over energy marketsCalls to subsidise coal are a sign of how the economics of power generation have been transformed,writesEd Crooks in theFinancial Times.The lights are dimming on King #Coal’s hold over #energy markets https://t.co/hc0ntCftenNew European pollution rules to hit Balkan plansEven though the new European Unionpollution control standardswill apply in most Western Balkan countries, the region’s governments are acting like they don’t exist,writesPippa Gallop from CEE Bankwatch Network.#Balkan governments are unprepared for new #EU #pollution rules http://bit.ly/LCP-BREF new #coal plants becoming even less feasible https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHbWwrfXsAAA0Gt.jpgCampaignsTop NewsTrump Administration rejects coal plant protection plan:TheUS Department of Energy, with the support of President Donald Trump, has rejected a proposal from Murray Energy to use the emergency provisions in the U.S. Federal Power Act to protect the merchant coal plants of the Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy Solutions. Murray Energy CEO, Bob Murray, wrote that he was “desperate” for the Trump Administration to intervene as the likely bankruptcy of one of his major customers would in turn force the “immediate bankruptcy” of his coal company. Murray was a major donor to the Trump campaign.(Associated Press,Murray Energy)Trump Administration axes coal pollution study:A US$1 million National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicinestudyon the public health risks of mountaintop coal mining has been halted just prior to public hearings commencing. The Interior Department directed all work on the project cease pending a budget review. The study was initiated late in 2016 by the Obama Administration after academic studies identified increased risks of cancer and other illnesses among residents living near mountaintop mining sites in West Virginia and Kentucky.(Charleston Gazette-Mail,SNL)Indian opposition calls for investigation into Adani:The Congress Party, India’s main opposition political party, has called for the Supreme Court to oversee a special Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into allegations Adani Group companies inflated the cost of imported equipment for its power stations. Congress argue that by inflating the cost of plant equipment and other facilities the Adani Group pushed power prices up by 3 US cents per kilowatt hour in the areas they supply. Last week theGuardianreleased part of a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) report into Adani Group’s transactions.(Business Standard,Hindustan Times)Thai agency committee clears coal plant assessment:Despitelimited public input, a committee of the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning Office has approved the Environmental and Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) for the proposed 2200 megawatt (MW)Thepa plantin southern Thailand. Residents argue that assessing the power plant separately from the proposed coal port gives a misleading impression of the total impact of the whole project. The EHIA has yet to be reviewed by the National Environment Committee.(The Nation,The Nation)Coal threat to Sydney water catchment:Anauditof the 16,000-square-kilometre Sydney Water Drinking Catchment has reported “an emerging issue of unquantified loss of surface flows associated” with the impacts of underground coal mines. However, the audit omitted any mention of the 29 to 40 million litres of water a day estimated to be already flowing into mines within two important catchment areas. A new study into mine waste water from the mothballed Berrima Colliery – which is also in the Sydney water catchment – has revealed high heavy metal pollution levels, including zinc levels 120 times higher than baseline levels.(Sydney Morning Herald,ABC News)“The really important development is not that solar is now two-and-a-half times cheaper than coal, but that solar is now becoming cheaper than coal fuel costs – with solar costs still decreasing. This is important because in future, solar systems can be financed solely from fuel savings,”saidMartin Green, the director of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics at the University of New South Wales.NewsAustralia:Delta Electricityseeks approvalfor 45 MW solar farm to sit with aging coal plant.Cambodia:Transparency Internationalsaysmining policy, including for coal, lacks key anti-graft protections.India:Chief Minister of Goa wants dust pollution at Mormugao Portcutbefore expansion considered.India:Supreme Courtcriticisesanti-corruption agency for slow progress in finalising coal cases.Japan:Mercury pollution in forests on Kyushublamedon Chinese coal plants.Myanmar:Residentsprotestas doubts grow that 40 MW coal plant at cement factory is legal.Pakistan:Bid for US$149 million toinvestigateviability of coal mines near Harnai in Balochistan province.Philippines:Department of Energybacksfast-track plan for 50 MW mine-mouth plant in Antique.US:Wyoming Republicansopposecoal baron’s bid for US$4.5 billion Appalachian coal subsidy.Companies + MarketsSenator questions support for expensive coal deals:Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, the chair of the Senate Committee on Energy in the Philippines Congress, has called for an explanation as to why the Energy Regulatory Commission is set to approve seven 20-year coal power purchase agreements (PPA) between Manila Electric Company (Meralco) and power generation companies. The PPA’s are reported to be for 11.7 US cents a unit even though Meralco recently signed a solar agreement for less than seven cents a unit. Public interest groups argue the PPA’s are “sweetheart deals” between Meralco and its subsidiaries or joint-venture companies.(The Nation)China debt bailout revives “zombie” coal and steel firms:AlmostUS$64 billion or 55 per cent of the Chinese Government’s debt-for-equity swaps in the last quarter were for financially stressed “zombie” companies in the overcapacity coal and steel sectors, according to the French investment bank Natixis. When China’s State Council unveiled the debt-for-equity plan in October 2016 it stated the program was aimed at reducing the interest costs only of viable companies and that “zombie” companies in over-capacity sectors would be excluded.(Bloomberg)Peabody pitches US coal survival plan:In apresentationto a US coal industry conference Peabody Energy has proposed a two-year moratorium on coal plant closures, the adoption of measures to “level the playing field between baseload [plants] and renewables” and lobbying states to adopt a “diverse portfolio standard” to keep coal generation in the mix. The company is also lobbying to keep its Kayenta mine in Arizona operating after the 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station by promoting the option of building a 185-kilometre long railway spur line to provide access to potential new markets.(SNL,Bloomberg BNA)Pakistan allocates funds for Thar water and resettlement:Balochistan High Court has ordered the China Power Hub Generation Company to appear in court to respond to pollution concerns raised by former speaker of the Balochistan Assembly, Mohammad Aslam Bhootani, over the proposed 1320 MW plant in Hub. In a separate development, the Pakistan Government has allocated US$120 million for the construction of a water supply canal for coal plants in the Thar coalfield while the Sindh provincial government has allocated US$6.4 million for the resettlement costs of displaced villagers.(Dawn,Radio Pakistan)Arm of World Bank backs coal-fuelled cement plant in Myanmar:The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, has agreed to invest US$15 million and lend a further US$20 million as part of a US$110 million plan for a cement plant in Mandalay Region, owned by the controversial Shwe Taung Conglomerate. Civil society groups have objected to the proposal, which also requires the expansion of the Kalewa coal mine in Sagaing Region to supply 150,000 tonnes of low-quality coal per year for the plant.(The Irrawaddy,Earth Rights International)Gupta’s fire sale to offload South African coal assets:The controversial Gupta family company Oakbay has announced that it is selling its coal mining subsidiary, Tegeta Exploration & Resources, to a little-known Swiss company for US220 million.
