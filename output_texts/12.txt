CoalWire: The India coal bubble, 150 US coal plants down and Bumi in freefallOctober 10, 2013View this email in your browserIndia’s coal bubbleA rapid increase in Indian coal demand has been a central theme in the coal industry’s ‘boom time’ narrative. However, the hype is becoming harder by the day to sustain: coal plants standling idle without coal to burn, the increasing costs of coal, loans souring, the lack of finance for new projects and developers unable to find buyers for part-completed plants. “Now the Indian coal bubble may have popped and no one seems to realize they're standing in the rubble,” writes Justin Guay, the Associate Director of the Sierra Club’s International Program.(Huffington Post)campaignsProtests against World Bank’s fossil fuel fundingThe Reclaim Power! Month of Action on Energy kicked off last weekend with protests outside the offices of the World Bank in Washington and Manila and against dirty energy projects in South Africa, India and Indonesia. The month of protests is aimed at highlighting the World Bank’s role in financing destructive energy projects around the world. Whilst the World Bank’s rhetoric suggests a move away from financing coal, its backdoor support for a coal plant in Indonesia and proposed loan for a 600 megawatt (MW) lignite coal power plant inKosovo paint a different picture.Current loans for the 4,000MW Tata Mundra coal plant in India and the 4,800 MWMedupi coal plantin South Africa are also controversial.(Reclaim Power!)US activists celebrate 150thplant milestoneWith the announcement of the scheduled retirement in 2017 of the Brayton Point Power Station in Massachusetts, the Sierra Club and 100 allied groups are celebrating the 150thannounced plant closure since 2010. The 150 plants represent over 60,000 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity and over double the capacity the campaign anticipated would be closed by 2020. The Sierra Club estimates that the 150 coal plant retirements will help to save 4,000 lives every year, and prevent 6,200 heart attacks and 66,300 asthma attacks every year. Three hundred and seventy two coal plants with an installed capacity of 282,000MW remain operating.(Sierra Club,Mike Bloomberg,Sierra Club infographic)top newsAustralia:Despite falling prices and slowing demand, Port Waratah Coal Services is seeking approval for a new coal export loader in Newcastle.
