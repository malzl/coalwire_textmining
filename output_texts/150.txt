InSri Lanka, the government has confirmed it no longer supports the controversial proposed Sampur coal plant.While the recentrise in coal priceshas generated excitement within the ranks of the coal industry and business commentators, this is mostly attributed to China’s coal mining rationalisation policy. With a recentagreementto fine-tune the implementation of the policy – while still meeting capacity reduction targets – analysts expect both thermal coal andmetallurgical coalprices to drop.FeaturesAnother coal domino falls as the Indian Government’s billion tonnes a year by 2020 target fadesAnother domino in India’s coal-centric energy policy has toppled with the Indian Government conceding its oft-stated aim of producing a billion tonnes a year of coal by 2020 is meaningless and unnecessary,writeBob Burton and Ashish Fernandes inEndCoal.Another #coal domino falls as Indian Government’s billion tonnes a yr by 2020 target fades #India http://endcoal.org/2016/09/another-coal-domino-falls-as-the-indian-governments-billion-tonnes-a-year-by-2020-target-fades/CampaignsSri Lanka scraps Indian-backed Sampur plantInresponseto a lawsuit brought by the Environmental Foundation challenging the proposed Sampur coal plant, Sri Lanka’s Attorney General has told the Supreme Court the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy will not proceed with the project. The Environmental Foundation had challenged the project on the grounds of discrepancies in the environmental impact statement for the plant and the long-term health effects from the use of coal. The 500 MW plant was proposed by a joint venture between the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Indian Government’s NTPC.

Aung Ko Ko, a senior official at the Ministry of Electricity and Energy, said many people were “reluctant to implement coal-fired power plants, that's why we won't be able to implement the planned coal power plant projects.” As of July 2016 Myanmar had just over 14,000 megawatts (MW) of proposed coal plants and a further 445 MW under construction.(Reuters,CoalSwarm)Norway dumps Duke Energy:Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has sold US$304 million of shares in Duke Energy and its three largest subsidiaries due to the risk of “severe environmental damage.” The Ethics Council, which advises the fund, noted the companies “repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina.” The fund has also divested US$245 million in bonds it held in the companies.(Bloomberg)Indian power companies flout waste water regulation:Indian power utilities are mostly flouting a Ministry of Power directive issued in January for coal plants within 50 kilometres of municipal wastewater plants to use treated water. The directive, intended to ensure raw water is used for agriculture and water supply, is being resisted because treated water costs more.(Times of India)US budget bill could gut coal ash standards:A water infrastructure budget bill likely to pass the US Senate includes a coal industry–backed amendment to overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) national standards regulating coal ash disposal. The proposed amendment would allow different standards to be adopted for each coal ash site. The EPA standards came into effect in 2014, six years after the December 2008 coal ash dam disaster at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant in Tennessee.(DeSmog,Environmental Integrity Project)IEA notes rise of renewables and coal overspend:The International Energy Agency’sWorld Energy Investment 2016reports investment in renewables was, for the first time, greater than global electricity demand growth in 2015. It also notes 80 per cent of the new investment in coal power generation is in Asia, with China accounting for half of that. The IEA warns “China has overinvested in new fossil fuel capacity” and continued construction of new coal plants is “inconsistent with market fundamentals.”(Carbon Brief,Bloomberg)“We wouldn’t look for new coal investments as it’s not worth it for the investor exposure,”saidGraham Kerr, the CEO of South32, the company launched in May 2015 to operate BHP Billiton’s unwanted South African coal mines.NewsAustralia:Despitedamagingwater supply to endangered swamps, Centennial Coal seeks mine expansion.Bangladesh:Amnesty Internationallaunchessupport for activist jailed over anti-coal Facebook posts.Greece:Gazpromflagsinterest in expanding the Vevi coal mine and Florina Power Station.India:Chargesfiledover alleged illegal export of coal to Bangladesh.UK:Proposed Druridge Bay mine to be subject toinquiryon compatibility with climate protection.Companies + MarketsFitch Ratings doubts durability of thermal coal price climb:Fitch Ratings, a major credit ratings agency, has warned the increase in the Asian thermal coal price is being driven by Chinese Government policy aimed at cutting oversupply, but is “not supported by improvements in demand fundamentals.” The agency warns the price rise could push China to ease its cuts to coal mining capacity.(Fitch Ratings)Chinese coal producers negotiate flexible production plan:MajorChinesecoal producers have reached an agreement with the China Coal Trade and Development Association and government agencies to facilitate production cuts or increases depending on prices and stockpile levels.

Vale’s Moatize mine has been hit by the collapse of global thermal and metallurgical coal prices.(AllAfrica)Mongolia seeks to revive Tavan Tolgoi project:The proposed development of the US$4 billion Tavan Tolgoi metallurgical coal project is being reconsidered after the election of a new government in June. In 2014 a proposal by Mongolian Mining Corporation, Shenhua Group and Sumitomo was blocked in parliament. The project foundered as metallurgical coal prices fell and the Chinese market contracted. To be viable the project requires higher Chinese demand as well as major infrastructure including power, water supply and transport links.(Reuters)Bankrupt US coal company agrees to end self-bonding:Arch Coal, one of the largest US coal companies, has agreed to provide US$485.5 million in rehabilitation liabilities for its Wyoming mines which had previously been covered by self-bonds allowed by federal regulators.
