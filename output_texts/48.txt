CoalWire: Germany & Japan post-Fukushima; Push to axe US ExIm Bank restrictions on coal.July 10, 2014How Opposite Energy Policies Turned The Fukushima Disaster Into A Loss For Japan And A Win For Germany“Japan has nine times Germany’s renewable energy resources. Yet Japan makes about nine times less of its electricity from renewables (excluding hydro power) than Germany does. That’s not because Japan has inferior engineers or weaker industries, but only because Japan’s government allows its powerful allies — regional utility monopolies — to protect their profits by blocking competitors,”writesAmory Lovins, the Chief Scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute, in a detailed analysis of the how the two countries responded to the Fukushima disaster and what it means for renewables and fossil fuel generation.Suggested Tweet:How Opposite Energy Policies Turned The Fukushima Disaster Into A Loss For Japan & A Win For Germany http://ow.ly/yUqzX @AmoryLovinsThe Australian coal export terminal that won’t be built“Market conditions suggest that Newcastle’s T4 [70 million tonnes per annum] coal terminal is extremely unlikely to be built … Analysts and investors who look at this project will quickly see that it is an extremely risky proposition. Current [Newcastle] coal loading facilities are under-utilised by 30 per cent – even they are on shaky ground at the moment. The last thing that the Port of Newcastle needs right now is another massive coal loader sitting idle,”writesTim Buckley inRenewEconomy.Suggested Tweet:The Australian #coal export terminal that won’t be builthttp://bit.ly/1meaisM#auspol #Newcastle #IEEFAcampaignsIndonesian coal plant stalled by landownersA consortium of Adaro Energy, J-Power and Itochu has declared force majeure to its main engineering contractors hired to build the 2,000 megawatt (MW) Central Java Power Plant.
