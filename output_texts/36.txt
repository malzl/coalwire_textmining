Last year the Land and Environment Court had rejected  the company’s application to expand its Warkworth mine to be far closer to the village of Bulga. John Krey, the vice president of the Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association, welcomed the rejection of Rio Tinto’s appeal and the award of costs against the company. However, he noted that on April 1 Rio Tinto had filed a new application for a mine expansion which would be decided under new pro-mining amendments to the planning legislation.(Sydney Morning Herald,The Global Mail)Suggested Tweet:Town of#Bulgabeats#RioTintoover proposed#coalmine expansionhttp://bit.ly/1mSeLPJSee local groups websitehttp://bit.ly/1hflzGyShenhua retreats on groundwater extractionThe world’s largest coal producer, Chinese government-owned Shenhua, has agreed to make concessions over its water use at a coal-to-liquids plant in Inner Mongolia.

And now increasingly from water use rules and limitations in western China, which are limiting the expansion of this industry in dry Inner Mongolia,writeGreenpeace campaigners Deng Ping and Harri Lammi.Suggested Tweet:#Shenhuamakes concessions in#Chinaover#wateruse in Inner Mongolia.
