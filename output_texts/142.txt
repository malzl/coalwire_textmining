While the moratorium will be reviewed in 2018, it is expected it will be extended. With about one-quarter of wind generation wasted in 2016 and the capacity-factor of coal plants falling due to   slowing power-demand growth, the freeze is intended to prevent over-investment in coal plants and ensure greater utilisation of renewable generation.(Australian Financial Review)Doubts raised about owner of Rio Tinto $1 Australian mine:TerraCom, the company which bought Rio Tinto’s Blair Athol mine in Queensland for $1, has been losing money and has debts of US$114 million.
