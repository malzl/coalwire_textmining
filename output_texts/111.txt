IEA’s coal review; China coal bubble; CCS’s troubled times; India tries to nobble Greenpeace, again.November 12, 2015View this email in your browsereditor's noteFailure is perhaps the word to best describe the coal industry’s last week: the failure of Peabody Energy to warn investors about the financial risks of action on climate change, the failure of the Kemper and Boundary Dam CCS projects to live up to their owners’ claims and the failure of the International Energy Agency to grasp the speed and magnitude of the changes to the global coal market.Bob BurtonCoalWire Editorfeatures2015: The year global coal consumption fell off a cliffIn the first half of 2015 global coal consumption fell by between 90 and 180 million tonnes — the largest drop on record —writesZachary Davies Boren and Lauri Myllyvirta at Greenpeace’sEnergyDesk.Tweet:2015: The year global #coal consumption fell off a cliff http://bit.ly/1MGaWrt @zdboren @laurimyllyvirtaChina’s coal bubble: building 155 new plants while many lay idleChina’s central and provincial governments have permitted 155 plants this year, even though there is already massive coal overcapacitywritesZachary Davies Boren in Greenpeace’sEnergyDesk.Tweet:#China’s #coal bubble: building 155 new plants while others lay idle http://bit.ly/1O2S4GD @zdboren @laurimyllyvirtaThe fallout from SaskPower’s Boundary Dam CCS debacleThe controversy over SaskPower’s troubled Boundary Dam CCS project will affect the coal industry’s PR pitch at the Paris climate conference in December,writesBob Burton inEndcoal.Tweet:The fallout from #SaskPower’s Boundary Dam #CCS debacle http://bit.ly/1WMVDIq @bobburtonoz #coalThe good, the bad and the ugly of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook on coalThe International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2015 is out, but its reliance on 2013 data renders its analysis of what is happening with coal out of date writes Bob Burton inEndCoal.Tweet:The good the bad and the ugly of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook on #coal #weo2015 @bobburtonozcampaignsIndian villagers defeat Sompeta power plantAfter an eight-year-long campaign – including an almost six-year-long relay hunger strike - a coalition of fisherfolk, villagers and environmentalists has defeated the proposed 2640 megawatt coal plant at Sompeta in Andhra Pradesh. In July 2010, when over 20,000 people marched in protest against the Nagarjuna Construction Company’s construction activities in the wetlands, police opened fire on the marchers, killing three and seriously injuring five others. In late August the State Government cancelled the land allocation for the power station and directed that the company only use it for agricultural projects. At a rally to celebrate the villagers’ campaign, the 2166 day-long hunger strike came to an end.(The News Minute,The Hindu)Tweet:After a 2166 day long relay hunger strike, villagers protesting #coal plant in #india can claim victory http://bit.ly/1Nqcvudtop newsIndian Government moves to shut Greenpeace down:The Indian Department of Home Affairs has cancelled Greenpeace India’s non-profit registration and directed the organisation to pass a resolution dissolving itself. The cancellation is the latest move by the Indian Government against Greenpeace, which has included banning one of its staff travelling to the UK, freezing its bank accounts and blocking the receipt of international funds. Greenpeace has rejected the government’s claims and has announced it will appeal against the ruling.(Greenpeace India)Peabody Energy forced to improve climate disclosures:The largest US coal producer, Peabody Energy, has agreed to include more detailed disclosure of the risks of lower coal demand due to moves to cut greenhouse gas emissions in its next filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. An investigation by New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman found the company inadequately disclosed financial risks associated with climate change.(New York Times,IEEFA)BHP Billiton to audit coal dams after Brazil disaster:In the wake of the devastating collapse of two tailings dams at an iron ore mine it half owns, BHP Billiton has announced it will audit all tailings dams at its coal, copper and iron ore mines. The tailings dam disaster at the Samarco mine has resulted in the death of six people, with 21 people missing and significant damage to seven towns. Hundreds are homeless. BHP Billiton has interests in 16 coal mines in Indonesia, Colombia, Australia and the US.(Sydney Morning Herald)OECD standoff over coal financing phase-out:South Korea and Australia are attempting to block a US-Japan proposal to wind back financing of coal plants at next week’s OECD meeting. The US-Japan proposal excludes financing for most of the lowest efficiency ‘subcritical’ plants, except small plants in the poorest countries. The proposal would end financing of all supercritical plants over 500 MW and restrict loans to a term of 12 years for all ultra-supercritical plants. Australia wants supercritical plants to be allowed to be financed, in order to shore up future markets for Australian coal.(Reuters,ClimateWire)New legal challenge against Adani’s Carmichael mine:The Australian Conservation Foundation has launched a legal challenge to the re-approval by the Federal Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, of Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin. The group is seeking a judicial review of Hunt’s decision on four grounds, including over whether he should have considered the impact of climate change from burning Carmichael coal on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. A hearing is not expected until early 2016.(Sydney Morning Herald,Environmental Defenders Office Queensland)“The so-called global coal boom in the first decade of the 21st century was a mirage … There was a Chinese coal boom, but that disguised what was happening in the rest of the world,”saidLauri Myllyvirta, Greenpeace’s Senior Global Coal campaigner.newsAustralia:Public support for coalfell9 per cent in three months of industry PR blitz.Global:ShellarguesCCS not viable without carbon price of US$60-80 per tonne.Chile:Solar and wind power biddersbeatcoal power in electricity auction.Colombia:Peak coal industry groupestimates2016 fall in coal exports.Taiwan:Coalition wantsendto expansion plan for Taiwan Semiconductor plant and power station.Vietnam:VinacominsignsMOU with China Development Bank for Vinh Tan 3 and other plants.companies + marketsCCS plant prompts Mississippi Power downgrade:Moody’s has further downgraded the financial rating of Mississippi Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, after a further US$110 million cost increase in the cost of the Kemper Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) plant. Moody’s noted that there were additional doubts about the ability of the company to fully recover costs on the US$6.3 billion plant due to the election of two new members of the Mississippi Public Service Commission which regulates power prices. Moody’s also noted “there are limits” to Southern Company’s financial support for its subsidiary and the Kemper plant.(Moody’s)Eskom adviser argues against increasing South African exports:Xavier Prevost from XMP Consulting, a coal consultant to Eskom, has argued South African exporters would be better off supplying coal to the domestic market than pursuing loss-making exports. “The more we export, the more the price drops,” he said. Prevost argues coal export prices are not expected to improve, making it more attractive for exporters to supply high-grade coal to Eskom and independent power producers.(Mining Weekly)Indian coal imports keep falling:For the fourth month in a row Indian coal imports have fallen compared to the same period last year. New trade ministry data indicates that for the April-to-October period coal imports have fallen by 4.6 per cent compared to the same period last year.
