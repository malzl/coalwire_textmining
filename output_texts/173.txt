March 9, 2017Issue 173|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteThe shift away from coal is accelerating – if the headlines of the past week are anything to go by.US coal plantspreviously thought to have years or decades to run are facing closure, whileCloud Peak Energyhas taken a further step back from its Pacific Northwest coal export plans. The collapse inUK coal consumptionin 2016 has prompted anewspaperowned by Rupert Murdoch to laud the rapid transformation as something “bigger polluters” should emulate.In India theCentral Electricity Authorityhas warned coal power utilities are at risk of financially crippling lower plant utilisation levels as a power glut grows and renewables expand. Meanwhile the government-ownedCoal India– which produces 80 per cent of the country’s coal – increased coal production, only to discover demand was so sluggish over one-tenth of it had to be diverted to stockpiles.Elsewhere, a court has ruled in favour of environmentalists in a legal challenge against a coal plant inSouth Africa, a USrailway companyhas agreed to clean up coal dust pollution and the discovery of 5000-year-oldburial groundsraises a new hurdle for a proposed coal mine in Poland.FeaturesUS coal company’s export retreat a sign of the timesCloud Peak Energy’sannouncementit has ditched its long-term coal export contract is the latest signal the US coal industry’s pipe dream of exporting coal to the Asian market continues to fade away,writesClark Williams-Derry from the Sightline Institute.This is the way #CloudPeak’s #US #coal export plans end: not with a bang but a whimper. http://bit.ly/2mu30Yo @ClarkWDerry @SightlineChina coal power plant approvals fall by 85 per centThe Chinese Government slashed approvals for new coal plants in 2016 with a dramatic slowing in the latter half of the year as massive overcapacity continues to undermine utilisation levels of current plants,writesLauri Myllyvirta inEnergyDesk.Big news from #China: New #coal power plant approvals fell by 85% last year @laurimyllyvirta @Energydesk http://bit.ly/2m3dpYC  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6MlNAyUwAADI_J.jpgCampaignsCourt directs Minister to consider climate impact of South African coal plantThe North Gauteng High Court has ruled in favour of Earthlife Africa and directed the Minister of Environmental Affairs consider the climate impacts when contemplating environmental authorisation for the proposed 630 megawattThabametsi power station. The Department of Environmental Affairs had previously approved the project even though no comprehensive assessment of the climate change impacts had been undertaken. The case was the first in South Africa challenging a project on climate change grounds.(Center for Environmental Rights,Mining Weekly)Court backs @Earthlife_JHB & directs #SouthAfrica's Env Minister consider #climate re new #coal power plantTop NewsDecline of UK coal delivers big cut in emissions:A52 per centdrop in the use of coal for power generation in 2016 has resulted in a 5.8 per cent fall in national carbon dioxide emissions, putting UK emissions about 36 per cent below 1990 levels. Driving the change has been the growth in renewables and gas generation and a floor price on carbon, which has accelerated the retirement of old coal plants. UK coal consumption is now 12 times lower than the 1956 peak of 221 million tonnes.(Carbon Brief)US railway company settles coal dust lawsuit:BNSF Railwayhas agreed to spend US$1 million to clean up coal and petroleum coke spilled from railcars in the Pacific Northwest. The agreement is part of a settlement of a Clean Water Act lawsuit brought by seven environmental groups. BNSF Railway has also committed to investigate the best available prototypes for covering wagons it uses to carry coal and petroleum coke from mines in Wyoming and Montana.(Portland Tribune)Discovery of ancient Polish burial grounds poses hurdle for new mine plan:Thediscoveryof burial grounds dating back 5000 years has bolstered hopes of local residents that the government will rejects plans by ZE PAK to build a new open-cut coal mine in Wielkopolska. Government officials are considering whether to designate the 15 recently discovered burial tombs with protected status. However, the Poznan regional environmental protection agency is considering issuing the environmental permit for the mine even though the company’s environmental assessment did not address the burial tombs.(Ancient Origins)More coal companies dropped by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund:A further 10 companies – including CEZ from the Czech Republic, Huadian Energy from China, PGE from Poland and Korea Electric Power Corporation from South Korea – have been dropped as investments by Norway’s US$900 billion Government Pension Fund. A further two companies were put on watch with another 24 companies at risk of exclusion. A coalition of environmental groups argues the fund needs to go further as it still has over US$3 billion invested in 32 companies that own coal mines or coal-fired power plants, as well as smaller investments in another 15 companies which transport coal or build coal plants.(Reuters,Norges Bank Investment Management)Peabody Energy ends self-bonding for US rehabilitation:Peabody Energy has announced it has obtained US$1.26 billion in commercial bonds and $14.5 million through the Indiana state bond pool to end its reliance on ‘self-bonding’ for mine rehabilitation liabilities. Previously Peabody Energy had argued providing commercial guarantees for its rehabilitation liabilities in Wyoming, Indiana, New Mexico and Illinois would adversely affect its ability to emerge as a viable company from bankruptcy.(Reuters)“This [a 52 per cent cut in UK coal use in a year] should have an immediate and positive effect on illness and premature death from respiratory disease, but cutting carbon emissions so fast has global implications too. If bigger polluters can follow suit, policymakers will be able to start thinking about reversing the build-up of atmospheric carbon not just as an idea but as a realistic possibility,”states[registration] aneditorialinThe Times,a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.NewsAustralia:NSW agencyannouncesdraft approval for Korea Resources Corporation mine in Central Coast water catchment.India:Tuticorin Thermal Power Station facesshutdowndue to water shortage.Pakistan:GovernmentspendingUS$1.5 million exploring Badin coal discovery in Sindh province.Ukraine:Nationalists blockade of coal imports from rebel controlled minesthreateningpower supply.Vietnam:Public alarm at threatposedby coal plants and ports to marine protected areas.Zimbabwe:Cash-strapped coal companyslashesproduction, crunching domestic power generation.“India is presently going through a defining shift in its energy mix from fossil fuels to renewable resources. In the coming decades, it is highly unlikely that the country will be a large consumer of coal for electricity generation or a major coal importer,”writesDr EAS Sarma, a former Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministries of Power and Finance.Companies + MarketsIndian coal power utilisation set to fall:TheCentral Electricity Authority(CEA) has warned utilisation rates of India’s coal plants could fall as low as 48 per cent by 2022, lower than the 55 per cent it estimates as necessary for financial viability. The CEA has flagged that many coal plants could be idled by 2022. Utilisation rates are falling as coal overcapacity increases and growing renewables and hydro capacity displace coal generation.(Economic Times)Coal India coal production growth slows:Coal production by the government-ownedCoal India(CIL) to the end of February – 11 months into the current financial year – was 490 million tonnes, just under 50 million tonnes short of its year-to-date target. In February CIL sold only 47.7 million tonnes of the 54.3 million tonnes produced, suggesting mine-mouth and railhead stockpiles have grown even further as power demand growth remains lower than expected and many of the distribution utilities continue to be financially stressed.(Economic Times,Coal India)Decline of US coal plants accelerates:Rapid changesin the US power market are forcing power plant owners to reassess the viability of existing coal plants. Despite twice having emerged from bankruptcy with new owners and less debt, the 1884 MW Homer City plant in Pennsylvania still requires costly plant upgrades to comply with the state’s pollution control standards and is once again facing fierce market competition. In Arizona, the Navajo Generating Station, which negotiated a deal with the US Environmental Protection Agency to continue operation until 2044, is now likely to close by 2019 after the consortium which owns it decided it was uneconomic.(Utility Dive,Fast Company)Troubles at Kemper CCS plant triggers downgrade:The Moody’s ratings agency has downgraded the credit rating of Mississippi Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, on concern about the economic viability of the 582 MW Kemper Carbon Capture and Storage plant. Moody’s described the plant as “increasingly uneconomic”, flagged doubts it would be able to win regulatory approval for cost recovery from ratepayers and noted the plant had substantially higher operating and maintenance costs than originally projected. Moody’s also noted the plant’s utilisation rate using coal-derived syngas is now projected to be 24 per cent lower in the first year than the original 59 per cent target and only reach 85 per cent in the fifth year of operation.(Mississippi Watchdog,Moody’s)Vale racks up more losses on Mozambique operations:Vale’s Mozambique subsidiary lost US$105 million in 2016 on the 8.8 million tonnes of coal produced that year. The result was an improvement on the US$508 million loss in  2015, in part due to higher global metallurgical coal prices and lower shipping costs. Coal exports in 2016 were more than double 2015 levels. Volumes shipped via Vale's newly commissioned Nacala railway increased in 2016, while the company lost US$215 million that year on coal shipments via the Sena railway to the port of Beira.(Macauhub,Vale)China looks to slash coal capacity:Premier Li Keqiang has vowed to eliminate more than 50,000 MW of new coal plant capacity in 2017 as China grapples with overcapacity and falling plant utilisation rates. The government also announced it plans to cut a further 150 million tonnes of coal mining capacity and slash steel plant capacity by 50 million tonnes this year. The government has allocated US$14.5 billion to cover relocation and other costs for an estimated 500,000 workers likely to be displaced this year by cuts to the coal and steel industries.(China Daily,Marketwatch,Bloomberg)ResourcesGetting it Right: a just transition strategy for Alberta’s coal workers,Alberta Federation of Labour, March 2017.
