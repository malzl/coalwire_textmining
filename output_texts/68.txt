This brought the coal production drop during the first 10 months of 2014 to 1.5 per cent and drop in imports to 8 per cent, while thermal power generation was still 0.1 per cent larger than last year. So what does this mean for China’s coal consumption this year, and for the following years?,”writesLauri Myllyvirta in Greenpeace’s Energy Desk.Suggested Tweet:Decline in #China’s #coal consumption steepens – how do we know and what does it mean? http://bit.ly/1HETowK @laurimyllyvirtaPeabody Fakes Social Media Campaign to Lobby G20 Leaders“Earlier this year US coal giant Peabody Energy launched a social media campaign to promote coal as an ‘advanced energy’ that will solve energy poverty in the developing world. Called ‘Advanced Energy for Life’ (AEfL), the campaign was launched in February, 2014 and now has, according to chief operating officer Glenn Kellow, prompted ‘500,000 people to lobby G20 leaders on the issue of energy poverty’. Unfortunately for anyone that takes Peabody at its word, the campaign appears to have been faked,”writesGreg McNevin from TckTckTck inClimate Spectator.Suggested Tweet:@PeabodyEnergy fakes “#LightsOnProject” grassroots campaign to pressure #G20 leaders http://bit.ly/1qYDsAI http://bit.ly/11NlzIF #CoalCoal's black wind: Pregnant women in parts of India advised to stay away“In some regions of India, a married woman will return to her mother’s house for the last trimester of pregnancy and the birth of her child.
