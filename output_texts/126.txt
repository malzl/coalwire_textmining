Drought hits Indian coal plants and plans; coal plants risk global water shortage.March 24, 2016View this email in your browsereditor's noteCoal and water don’t mix, or at least they shouldn’t. This week another coal ship sank in Bangladesh in the Sundarbans World Heritage site, nearby the sites of two proposed coal plants.
