Indian air crisis forces plant shutdowns; Poland’s coal woes; Anglo’s coal meltdown.December 10, 2015View this email in your browsereditor's noteOver the last week nothing has gone right for the coal industry. Part way through the Paris climate talks Beijing issued a ‘red’ alert over appalling air quality while New Delhi – with even worse air quality – finally bowed to community outrage and announced the shutdown of two and possibly three coal plants. While coal lobbyists were busing hyping coal’s prospects, Anglo American – one of the world’s largest coal exporters – was announcing it is keen to sell many of its coal projects.Bob BurtonCoalWire EditorfeaturesPolish Government bailout for loss-making coal mines may break EU lawsPoland’s plan to force government-owned power utilities to buy Kompania Weglowa’s loss-making coal mines and other financial subsidies may break two European Union laws,writesKrystina Shveda in Greenpeace’sEnergyDesk.Tweet:80% of Polish coal plants aren't profitable; but the government's rescue plan may be illegal http://bit.ly/1IPWcWrEurope needs to accelerate coal plant phase-out to meet climate targetsThe European Union needs to accelerate its coal plant shut down by as much as three times as currently planned to meet its climate targets,writesZachary Boren at Greenpeace’sEnergyDesk.Tweet:#Europe needs to accelerate #coal plant phase out to meet #climate targets @zdboren http://bit.ly/1Oh4rwstop newsAdani demands ban on Australian legal actions:The chairman of the Adani Group, Gautam Adani, has told journalists that he met Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on November 4 to request a law be passed to extinguish legal challenges to his company’s proposed Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin. “The politicians have to go to Parliament and enact a special law which says that once the government gives approval, no one can challenge it,” Adani said. Adani also conceded the project hasn’t been able to attract finance and implied the project is not viable at current global prices.(Livemint,EndCoal)Scottish regulator warns of risks with underground coal-to-gas:Draft reports by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) warned of “sometimes unknowable” risks associated with underground coal gasification (UCG) projects. After reviewing UCG projects in Europe, the US and Australia, Sepa warns risks include air and water pollution, “uncontrollable” underground fires and underground explosions. Two companies - Cluff Natural Resources and Five Quarter – have UCG licences which are strongly opposed by residents.(Herald Scotland)Outrage over Indian smog forces plant shutdowns:Public outrage at extreme air pollution in New Delhi, which has been ranked by the World Health Organization as the world’s most polluted city, has spurred the Delhi government to shutdown two coal plants within a week. The Delhi government has announced the closure of the 700 megawatt (MW) Badarpur plant and the 1820 MW Rajghat plant, though it is unclear whether the closure is temporary or permanent. A third plant in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh is also slated to be closed.(Times of India,International Business Times)Study finds CCS costs underestimated:A study published inEnvironmental Science and Technologyhas found the costs of CCS plants in the US have been significantly underestimated. Previous studies estimated the additional fuel cost of a CCS plant over a conventional plant at US$29 million per year while the authors estimated it is actually $126 million a year. The authors note this makes CCS plants more expensive than wind and comparable to solar in the US, and potentially globally.(Michigan News,Environmental Science and Technology)“So why all the happy noises [from Rio Tinto about the future of coal]?

The company stated it will only retain low cost coal projects which are “producing premium quality products.” The company operates six thermal coal export mines in South Africa, four mines in Australia and has a one-third stake in the Cerrejon mine in Colombia. Details of the mines will be closed or sold will be finalised in February.(Anglo American,Anglo American)Funds hard to find as Poland plans coal rescue plan:The plan by Poland’s new pro-coal Prime Minister, Beata Szydlo, to require power utilities to merge with the loss-making coal industry has hit the valuations of the four public power companies. Polska Grupa Energetyczna’s (PGE) shares have fallen 30 per cent since the start of the year. Last week PGE’s chief financial officer, Magdalena Bartos, said that the company was already “receiving more and more signals from investment banks that they are not interested in lending money for such [coal] projects. This trend will intensify.”(Reuters,Platts)Thermal coal glut grows to record volumes:A Bloomberg Intelligence report estimates that there are 118 million tonnes of surplus thermal coal in 2016 as demand falls in importing countries such as China, and India increases domestic production. Andrew Cosgrove from Bloomberg Intelligence estimates thermal coal may need to fall to US$40 a tonne before existing coal exporters cut substantial production. Platts reports the Newcastle benchmark price has fallen to US$50 a tonne, its lowest level in a decade.(Bloomberg,Platts)India signals plan to cut met coal imports:In a bid to cut coking coal imports for steel plants the Indian Coal and Power Minister, Piyush Goyal, has urged the newly created National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) to fund exploration for metallurgical coal deposits. Goyal wants to mimic his thermal coal strategy of boosting domestic production in a bid to cut foreign exchange outflows for coal. It is estimated India is likely to import about 54 million tonnes of metallurgical coal in 2015.(Mining Weekly,Australian Government)The US industry’s loss-making ‘zombie mines’:An assessment of the future of the US coal industry by consultancy firm McKinsey estimates that even if the industry cuts production by 20 per cent by 2020 it would still have about US$70 billion in debt and liabilities, including mine site rehabilitation costs. The phenomena of companies running loss-making mines to cover interest and bondholder costs, McKinsey wrote, has created “a collection of ‘zombie mines’ that cannot turn a profit but are too costly to close.”(SNL,McKinsey)China thermal coal imports keep falling:Over the January to October period this year China’s thermal coal imports have fallen by 39 per cent compared to the same period in 2014.(Business Insider)resourcesEnd of an Era, Greenpeace UK and Climate Action Network Europe, December 2015.
