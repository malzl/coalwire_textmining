India wants freeze on new coal plants; Chinese blow to high-efficiency hype; alarm over Colombian river plan.June 9, 2016View this email in your browsereditor's noteThe unofficial warning by the Indian Government’s Ministry of Power that no company should start building new coal plants in the next three years may well be a critical turning point in preventing further damage to the global climate.
