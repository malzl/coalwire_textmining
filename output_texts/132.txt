Global protests against coal; Dubai solar bid 1/3 less than coal; Colombian coal hits Asian market.May 5, 2016View this email in your browsereditor's noteA two-week series of global events against coal and other fossil fuel projects, under theBreak Free from Fossil Fuelsbanner, has kicked off with two protests: a day-long occupation of the UK’s largest open-cut coal mine and a mass rally in Batangas City against proposed coal plants in the Philippines. Other actions are planned in Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Turkey, South Africa and other countries  this week and next. Disruption of the coal industry is occurring on other fronts too: water shortages threaten to force the closure of more Indian coal plants while Coal India is finally cutting production due to a domestic coal glut. Meanwhile, Colombian coal, increasingly shunned in Europe, is now being pushed into the Pacific market, further undermining the prospects for new and existing projects in Australia, Indonesia and the West Coast of the US.Bob BurtonCoalWire EditorfeaturesPeabody Energy’s contrarian witnesses lose their case over the cost of coalAn administrative law judge has rejected arguments from Peabody Energy and three high-profile climate contrarians and agreed that the social cost of coal used by the Minnesota Government was too low,writesDr John Abraham in theGuardian.Tweet:#Peabody’s contrarian scientist witnesses lose their case over the cost of #coal http://bit.ly/23jJetn #climateDubai’s solar price plunge spells big trouble for coalThe price of large-scale solar PV power plants has plunged further with the winning bid at an auction of solar capacity in Dubai coming in just below three US cents per kilowatt hour (c/kwh) compared to over 4.5 c/kwh the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority recently agreed to for the Hassyan coal plant,writesGiles Parkinson inRenewEconomy.Tweet:Dubai #solar auction price comes in at <3 c/kwh, 30% less than Hassyan #coal plant http://bloom.bg/1riMObdcampaignsProtest shuts UK’s largest open cut mineA colourful day-long occupation involving 300 protestors shut the Ffos-y-fran mine in Wales down for a day.

While the modelling suggested increased rainfall in some areas, such as Australia, it found reductions in more areas than increases. However, the study did not model the effects caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions.(MIT News,Journal of Climate)Philippines archbishop urges break with coal:Archbishop Ramon Arguelles has urged voters to elect “leaders who are pro-people and pro-environment, not pro-coal and pro-climate change” at the May 9 Philippines general election.
