The moratorium proposal has been welcomed by civil society groups but provoked mixed reactions in the coal industry. The Director General for Coal and Minerals at the Energy Ministry, Bambang Gatot, said there were 10,388 coal mining permit holders in Indonesia but over one-third lacked a ‘clean and clear certificate’ certifying they had paid royalties, taxes and complied with environmental requirements. According to major coal producer Adaro Energy, Indonesian coal production is expected to fall by 11 per cent this year to 419 million tonnes.(Indonesia Investments,Platts)Emails reveal North Carolina sought misleading ‘all clear’ on polluted water:A Freedom of Information request has revealed North Carolina State Toxicologist Ken Rudo refused to sign a letter telling residents affected by coal-ash contaminated wells that their water was safe for drinking and cooking.

Duke Energy has sought a court order to suppress part of Rudo’s deposition in a case over pollution from Duke Energy’s closed Buck plant.(Winston-Salem Journal,Shelby Star)US utility unveils plan to leave coal ash in unlined pits:The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government-owned utility, has unveiled plans to leave millions of tonnes of coal ash in unlined dams at 10 sites in Tennessee and Alabama. The TVA states capping the coal-ash dams and leaving them in place is the fastest, cheapest and safest option. However, environmental groups argue the best way to reduce the groundwater contamination risk to the three million people in the affected catchments is to relocate the ash to lined landfills.(Climate Progress,Southern Environmental Law Center)Security concerns delay bidding for Bangladesh plant:The Bangladeshi Government has suspended the bidding process for the 1200 megawatt (MW) Matarbari plant pending increased security measures for the competing Japanese companies. Seven Japanese were among the 20 killed in the July 1 terrorist attack on a restaurant in Dhaka.

Vale produced 1.4 million tonnes of metallurgical coal and 740,000 tonnes of thermal coal from the mine. Vale has been forced to suspend using the Sena railway, which runs to Beira port, due to an attack in July in which a train driver was shot. In June the railway was closed for two weeks due to an earlier attack.(AllAfrica,Macauhub)Alberta moves to audit mines rehab costs:The Alberta Energy Regulator is moving to audit the nine coal mines in the province which supply power stations to ensure the operator’s “security deposit is sufficient for the liability cost” of mine closure and rehabilitation. Alberta aims to phase out coal plants by 2030. A 2015 report by Alberta's auditor general found that only three of the 19 coal mines in the province – which include metallurgical coal mines – had been subject to a detailed audit of their rehabilitation security deposit.(CBCnews)Anglo American writes down Australian met coal mines:Anglo American has written down the value of its Moranbah North and Grosvenor metallurgical coal mines by $US1.25 billion as it expects metallurgical coal prices to remain at about US$100 a tonne for between three and five years. Anglo American also disclosed production at the Cerrejon thermal coal mine in Colombia – in which it has a one-third stake – fell by 21 per cent due to heavy rainfall in May and June and “ongoing planned production cuts to take out the highest cost capacity in response to market conditions.”(Australian Financial Review ($),Anglo American)Pakistan hedges on Japan’s coal financing bid:Pakistan has signalled it may reject an offer from Japan to finance the US$1.7 billion cost of a new Lakhra 650 MW supercritical coal plant due to its higher cost compared to other projects, and coal railway infrastructure constraints. In a separate development the Pakistani Government imposed a ban on new coal plants based on imported coal, preferring either the establishment of hydro or domestic coal projects.(Express Tribune,The News)Coal outages in Philippines triggers investigation:The withdrawal of almost 3000 MW of generating capacity, including four coal plants with 1632 MW capacity, led to major power load shedding in the major grid on the island of Luzon. The Department of Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi has requested the Energy Regulatory Commission investigate whether the sudden withdrawal of capacity was “caused by anticompetitive behaviour by the industry players.”(Philippine Daily Inquirer,Manila Standard)ResourcesGreasing the Wheels,Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australia Institute,June 2016.
