WWF said that the three countries are attempting to derail talks that could cut international coal finance from such agencies, which are state-owned mechanisms that fund or underwrite overseas projects that domestic companies are involved in,”writesKarl Mathiesen in theGuardian.Suggested Tweet:@OECD countries spend billions in public money for coal despite #climate crisis.

These predictions are made by the Energy Information Administration. They are ostensibly apolitical, certified with a federal seal of approval and are ripe fodder for the journalists, analysts and government agencies responsible for painting a picture of the country's energy future. But in truth, some experts say, we'd have better luck calling Miss Cleo [an American psychic who ran a pay-per-call service],”writesAlan Neuhauser inUS News & World Report.Suggested Tweet:The pitfalls of the US Energy Information Administration’s policy-neutral approach http://bit.ly/1QipCiM @alneuhauserHow Did WoodMac Get China’s Coal Demand So Wrong?“Back in June 2013 Wood Mackenzie, a high-profile mining and energy consultancy favoured by the coal industry, boldly proclaimed that Chinese thermal coal demand would double to approximately 7 billion tonnes a year by 2030. Just on two years later it is clear that the company hopelessly misread crucial factors affecting demand, not least the determination of the Chinese Government to take decisive action on the country’s appalling air pollution. How did WoodMac – as the consultancy is widely referred to – get China’s coal demand so wrong?,”writesBob Burton inRenewEconomy.Suggested Tweet:How did WoodMac get #China’s #coal demand so wrong? asks @bobburtonoz @renew_economy http://bit.ly/1GjMgbscampaignsColombian court derails Fenoco’s coal railway planColombia’s Constitutional Court has extended a six-hour overnight coal train ban from Bosconia township to also include three municipalities in the neighbouring province of Magdalena. The ruling was in response to a complaint by three communities over noise pollution from Fenoco’s railway line to Puerto Nuevo coal port. The railway is used by Drummond, Glencore’s subsidiary Prodeco and Goldman Sachs' company CNR. The court has also ordered Fenoco to suspend construction on a second track for three months in Magdalena while it investigates whether the local communities had been properly consulted.(Reuters)Suggested Tweet:Colombia extends restrictions on Fenoco’s #coal railway plan over noise http://reut.rs/1KCxGt9 #Drummond #Glencore #GoldmanSachsDecade-long campaign prods Indian Government to demand an end to coal pollution of the Damodar RiverFollowing a decade-long campaign by a coalition of civil society groups including Damodar Bachao Andolan, the Minister for Power and Coal, Piyush Goyal has directed that within three months the government-owned power generator Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and coal mining subsidiaries of Coal India limited (CIL) must end their pollution of the Damodar River in Jharkhand.

Despite the commissioning of over 22,600 megawatts (MW) of new coal-fired generation capacity in the last year and GDP growth estimated at 7.3 per cent, economists have raised doubts that the economy is growing as fast as the statistics suggest. One factor in the fall in power generation is that debt-laden state-based electricity distribution companies can’t afford to purchase electricity.(Livemint,Business Standard)Teck shuts Canadian met coal mines:Teck Resources has announced that it will shut all six of its metallurgical coal mines in British Columbia for three weeks in the next quarter.
