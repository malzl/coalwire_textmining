But when the company entered our village surreptitiously, we didn't know how to react.’ Ram was referring to Adani Mining, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, which came to the area in 2009 to mine the 450 million-tonne rich coal blocks of Parsa East and Kanta Basan,”writesRaksha Kumar inScroll.Suggested Tweet:#Adani #coal mine threatens a forest in Chhattisgarh, #India writes @Raksha_Kumar @scroll_inIf Edwardsport Is the Future of Coal-Fired Power, It’s Not a Very Bright Future“Back in the early 2000s, integrated gasification combined cycle power plants (IGCC) were touted by proponents as the future of coal-fired electricity generation …  Though the company [Duke Energy] has promoted Edwardsport (IGCC plant in Indiana, US) as an innovative leap forward in power generation, the plant today seems more an experiment gone wrong—and one that Duke’s customers have largely had to pay for,”writesAnna Sommer, the  president of the US utility-regulation consulting firm, Sommer Energy.Suggested Tweet:If @DukeEnergy’s Edwardsport plant is the future of #coal-fired power, it’s not a very bright future http://ieefa.org/?p=4390 @ieefa_institutecampaignsWorld Health Congress Calls for Thermal Coal Phase-OutThe World Congress on Public Health, which was hosted by the Indian Public Health Association, has backed the need for “a rapid phase-out of coal” for power generation to protect public health.
