December 7, 2017Issue 211|View Past IssuesEditor's NoteOver the last week the two dominant themes have been the widespread pollution from coal and the industry’s growing demands for even more subsidies. InIndia, the international cricket match between India and Sri Lanka was interrupted by extreme pollution, in part caused by dirty coal plants. A few days beforehand, India’s environmentaltribunaldemanded the national pollution regulator submit evidence on what it was doing to enforce new pollution control standards on coal plants. Meanwhile, regulators inGoahave revealed a major coal port was illegally handling over double the volume of coal it was authorised to. For its part,Adanihas even more challenges after India’s customs agency is set to challenge a decision blocking the investigation of allegations of tax fraud. InAustralia, the Chinese Embassy has dashed Adani’s hopes of obtaining funding from Chinese banks for its beleaguered Carmichael coal project.As the economic viability of coal plants has been eclipsed by other forms of generation, the industry has increased its efforts to win huge new long-term subsidies. In theUS, the coal lobby is pitching for tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to prop up the entire coal fleet. InEurope, the Estonian European Union Presidency is pressing to allow capacity payments for old coal plants.FeaturesAs UK leads global coal phase move, at home locals confront mining plansWhile the UK Government has championed moves for a global coal phase-out, at home proposals for a new coal mine and the expansion of another are being resisted by residents,writesMat Hope inDeSmog UK.From the valleys to the beaches, new#coal mines bring fear not hope https://www.desmog.uk/2017/11/29/new-coal-mines-ffos-y-fran-druridge-bay#climatechangeIn Poland’s coal heartland, residents look to a cleaner futureIn Poland’s coal heartland, Upper Silesia, residents prepare for a transition to a cleaner future,writesClaudia Ciobanu inJust Transition.The backup plan: Poles prepare for post-#coal life despite government @Claudia_Warsaw #Poland #JustTransition http://www.just-transition.info/the-backup-planCampaignsChinese banks dump Adani’s Carmichael bidTheChinese Embassyin Australia has told Australia’s former foreign minister, Bob Carr, that China will not fund Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal project in Queensland. Carr told the media that he had been told by Embassy officials that "the relevant company will discontinue discussions with Adani over possible co-operation.” In November, Adani flagged that it was negotiating to have China Machinery Engineering Corporation build its proposed coal railway. In the days before Carr’s statement three major Chinese banks — China Construction Bank, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and the Bank of China — had ruled out providing financial support for the project. The announcements, which follow a three-week campaign by community groups to persuade Chinese banks to avoid the project, may finally cause the project to collapse.(Sydney Morning Herald,ABC News)Top NewsNew Delhi smog forces coal rethink:Extreme airpollutionin New Delhi caused physical distress among players and forced delays to an India-Sri Lanka cricket match.

The Sena railway, the original and shorter route for coal exports, has been subject to guerrilla attacks, while Beira port can only cater for 40,000 tonne ships due to its shallow access channel and the constant need for dredging. Vale’s Nacala port can cater for bulk carriers capable of carrying 180,000 tonnes.(Macauhub)ResourcesIndia Energy Transition: mapping subsidies to fossil fuels and clean energy in India, International Institute of Sustainable Development (IISD), the Overseas Development Institute and ICF India, December 2017.
