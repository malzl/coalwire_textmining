Provincial leaders raised concerns about the impacts of the project on fisheries and public health in the environmentally sensitive Mekong Delta, already targeted for multiple coal plants. Instead, the leaders urged more aggressive adoption of wind and other “Green Economy” power options. (VSEA and NCD press release,CoalSwarm)Bangladesh drops open-pit mine option at BarapukuriaEnergy and Mineral Resources Division secretary Nazimuddin Chowdhury said the company will not pursue an expansion of the existing Barapukuria underground coal mine, due to major land subsidence at the current mine and risk to the aquifer from open-pit mining. Shares of GCM Resources, which is also pursuing an open-pit mine at Phulbari, dropped 23 percent on the Barapukuria news.(Energy Bangla)Top NewsChina funding at least 52,000 MW of coal plants across the globe:New data collected byChinaDialogueandCEE BankwatchfindsChinesebanks and companies are currently involved in at least 79 coal fired generation projects across the globe, with a total capacity of over 52,000 MW. Huaneng—one of five state-owned energy giants—plans to significantly boost its share of profits from overseas projects by 2020, according to itsfive-year strategy. Since 2000, China has overtaken Japan to become the leading exporter of coal equipment.(ChinaDialogue)Coal plans falter in Indonesia:According toThe Jakarta Post, the Indonesian government’s ambitious plan to build 35,000 MW of new power plants by 2019 is far behind schedule, with only 195 MW completed and 22 percent in construction. With demand for power slowing and excess capacity in most regions, some officials saw the slowdown as “a blessing in disguise” to avoid oversupply.(The Jakarta Post)Irregularities surrounding Indonesia’s Jawa-5 bidding draw criticism:The 2000 MWJawa-5 power stationwas originally presented by state power company PLN as an independent power project, but after abruptly cancelling the bidding process, PLN assigned Jawa-5 to its subsidiary Indonesia Power and Mitsubishi.

While the assignment was technically legal, critics questioned Mitsubishi’s favorable treatment in receiving the US$2.3 billion project.(Tempo.co)China’s Shenhua Coal may raise coal production to lower international prices:Due in large part to domestic production cuts in China, the price of thermal coal has gone up 41 percent this year, even as China’s overall demand for coal has fallen this year. To lower coal prices, China’s National Development and Reform Commission met last week and is reportedly encouraging state-run Shenhua Coal to raise production and flood the market, in order to bring prices like exports from Australia’s Newcastle terminal to the US$50 – US$60 range, compared with US$71.55 a ton at present.(Bloomberg)“China is trying to create a buyer’s cartel in the coal market, an outcome that could be quite as bad for producers of the fuel as the OPEC seller's cartel was for consumers of crude oil in the 1970s,”writesBloomberg’s David Fickling about China’s plan to flood the market by increasing domestic coal production.China's buyer's cartel will be as bad for coal producers as OPEC was for oil buyers: http://bloom.bg/2dfvKhNNewsAustralia:Victoria's 1600 MW Hazelwood power station toclosein April 2017.Philippines:President Dutertecommissions405 MW Misamis Oriental coal plant.Japan:Jera, a joint venture between Tepco and Chubu Electric Power,confirmsplans to build 1300 MW Yokosuka coal plant by FY2022-23.India:Governmentshelvescoal block auctions, citing ample supplies and weak demand.Pakistan:Bin Qasim Association of Trade and Industryjoinswith environmentalists in raising objections to a proposed new coal jetty at Port Qasim, citing concerns over coal dust.Australia:Carmichael coal proposaldownsizedto 25 million tonnes per annum with investment decision deferred to end 2017.China:Central governmentcancels15 new coal power plant projects with a total capacity of 12,400 MW in crackdown on illegal construction.China:At least 18 peoplekilledand two missing after an explosion in Ningxia coal mine.Companies + MarketsSettlement reached with Duke for 2014 Dan River coal ash spill:On September 23 the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality settled with Duke Energy for the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill.

The sale had been opposed by environmentalists who had lobbied for Vattenfall to close the mines and plants rather than sell them.(Platts)Resources“The Sky’s Limit: Why the Paris Climate Goals Require a Managed Decline of Fossil Fuel Production,” Oil Change International, in collaboration with 350.org, Rainforest Action Network, and others, September 22, 2016This new report finds the totalcarbonemissions contained in the world’s currently operating oil, gas, and coal fields would take us beyond 2°C of warming, while the reserves in the active oil and gas fields alone would exceed 1.5°C, even with no coal. The report builds upon 2011 findings by Carbon Tracker Initiative that global proven fossil fuel reserves contain five times more carbon than can be burned for 2°C.“Mapped: How Germany Generates its Electricity,” Carbon Brief, September 20, 2016An interactive map created by Carbon Brief shows all of Germany’s electricity sources by type, along with atimelinetracking the history of Germany’s Energiewende. The group notes coal still supplies more energy in Germany than all low-carbon sources combined, but finds renewables supplied around a third of German electricity in 2015, a record-high level for the country.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterForward to a FriendSubscribe
