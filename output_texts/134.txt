In January 2014 a directive by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF) required the use of coal with an ash content of lower than 34 per cent. The NGT agreed with Rangari and in October 2015 ruled Coal India and Maharashtra power utilities should ensure compliance with the standard. They ignored the tribunal’s ruling. Now the tribunal has given the coal and power utilities until July 13 to explain why their permits to operate mines and power stations should not be cancelled.(The Hitavada,Times of India)Tweet:Showdown looms between court & #CoalIndia over #coal pollution http://bit.ly/1WBR8zv #Indiatop newsColombian coal port on hold due to pollution:Colombia’s environmental regulator has suspended the operating permit for Santa Marta coal terminal after an inspection revealed it was in breach of pollution control standards.
